# Study App V3 Backend - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
A comprehensive AWS certification study platform backend built with AWS CDK, TypeScript, and serverless Lambda functions. The system provides adaptive learning sessions, progress tracking, analytics, and goal management for AWS certification exam preparation.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.2.2
- **Architecture**: AWS Serverless (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB + S3)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- **Testing**: Jest with ts-jest, aws-sdk-client-mock for AWS mocking
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Build**: TypeScript compiler with esbuild bundling for deployment

## Key Features
- **Question Management**: 1,082+ AWS certification questions in S3 storage
- **Adaptive Sessions**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance
- **Progress Analytics**: Comprehensive learning insights and performance tracking
- **Goal System**: User-defined learning goals with milestone tracking
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks and diagnostics

## Current Implementation Status
- **Overall**: 90% complete (27/30 phases)
- **Core Features**: All major functionality implemented and working
- **Remaining**: JWT authentication system (Phase 30) and minor enhancements

## Architecture Pattern
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between handlers, services, repositories
- **Service Factory**: Centralized dependency injection pattern
- **Base Handler Pattern**: Standardized request/response handling with middleware
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer for DynamoDB and S3
