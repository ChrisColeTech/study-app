CloudWatch Logs:** By publishing VPC flow logs to CloudWatch Logs, you can analyze the logs using metric filters to extract relevant information.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns. It helps optimize costs by automatically selecting the most cost-effective tier for each object. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads: This is a good practice to clean up any incomplete multipart uploads, which can consume additional storage space without contributing to the actual objects. Cleaning up incomplete uploads helps manage storage costs efficiently.",

Writing orders to an SQS queue allows for decoupling the EC2 instances processing the orders from the application writing the orders. EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group can then read from the SQS queue, ensuring that the processing scales with demand. Using an Auto Scaling group ensures that you can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the workload. This can help handle high traffic efficiently.",
