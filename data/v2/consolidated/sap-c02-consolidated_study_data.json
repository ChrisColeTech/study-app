        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The company should purchase the same Reserved Instances for an additional 3-year term with All Upfront payment. The company should purchase a 3-year Compute Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in the management account to cover any additional compute costs. This solution will provide the company with the most cost savings because Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are both pricing models that offer significant discounts compared to On-Demand pricing. Reserved Instances are commitments to use a specific instance type and size in a single Region for a one- or three-year term. You can choose between three payment options: No Upfront, Partial Upfront, or All Upfront. The more you pay upfront, the greater the discoun1t. Savings Plans are flexible pricing models that offer low prices on EC2 instances, Fargate, and Lambda usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year term. You can choose between two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans apply to any EC2 instance regardless of Region, instance family, operating system, or tenancy, including those that are part of EMR, ECS, or EKS clusters, or launched by Fargate or Lambda. EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to a specific instance family within a Region and provide the most savings2. By purchasing the same Reserved Instances for an additional 3-year term with All Upfront payment, the company can lock in the lowest possible price for its EC2 instances that run continuously for 3 years. By purchasing a 3-year Compute Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in the management account, the company can benefit from additional discounts on any other compute usage across its member accounts. The other options are not correct because: Purchasing a 1-year Compute Savings Plan with No Upfront payment in each member account would not provide as much cost savings as purchasing a 3-year Compute Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in the management account. A 1-year term offers lower discounts than a 3-year term, and a No Upfront payment option offers lower discounts than an All Upfront payment option. Also, purchasing a Savings Plan in each member account would not allow the company to share the benefits of unused Savings Plan discounts across its organization. Purchasing a 3-year EC2 Instance Savings Plan with No Upfront payment in the management account to cover EC2 costs in each AWS Region would not provide as much cost savings as purchasing Reserved Instances for an additional 3-year term with All Upfront payment. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers lower discounts than Reserved Instances for the same instance family and Region. Also, a No Upfront payment option offers lower discounts than an All Upfront payment option. Purchasing a 3-year EC2 Instance Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in each member account would not provide as much flexibility or cost savings as purchasing a 3-year Compute Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in the management account. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan applies only to a specific instance family within a Region and does not cover Fargate or Lambda usage. Also, purchasing a Savings Plan in each member account would not allow the company to share the benefits of unused Savings Plan discounts across its organization.

The company should use an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy to automatically fail over to the DR Region in the event of a disaster. The company should increase the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. This solution will meet the requirements most cost-effectively because AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) is a service that minimizes downtime and data loss with fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications using affordable storage, minimal compute, and point-in-time recovery. AWS DRS enables RPOs of seconds and RTOs of minute1s. AWS DRS continuously replicates data from the source servers to a staging area subnet in the DR Region, where it uses low-cost storage and minimal compute resources to maintain ongoing replication. In the event of a disaster, AWS DRS automatically converts the servers to boot and run natively on AWS and launches recovery instances on AWS within minutes2. By using AWS DRS, the company can save costs by removing idle recovery site resources and paying for the full disaster recovery site only when needed. By creating a cross-Region read replica for the DB instance, the company can have a standby copy of its primary database in a different AWS Region3.

It provides a way to schedule automatic backups for CodeCommit repositories on an hourly basis. Additionally, it also supports cross-Region replication, which allows you to copy the backups to a second Region for disaster recovery. By using AWS Backup, the company can set up an automatic and regular backup schedule for the CodeCommit repository, ensuring that the data is regularly backed up and stored in a second Region.

        "explanation": "The company should create a new AWS WAF web ACL. The company should add a new rule that blocks requests that match the SQL database rule group. The company should set the web ACL to allow all other traffic that does not match those rules. The company should attach the web ACL to the ALB in front of the ECS tasks. This solution will meet the requirements because AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and control web requests that are forwarded to your web applications. You can use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rules that control which traffic can access your web applications and which traffic should be blocked1. By creating a new AWS WAF web ACL, the company can create a collection of rules that define the conditions for allowing or blocking web requests. By adding a new rule that blocks requests that match the SQL database rule group, the company can prevent SQL injection attacks from reaching the ECS API service. The SQL database rule group is a managed rule group provided by AWS that contains rules to protect against common SQL injection attack patterns2. By setting the web ACL to allow all other traffic that does not match those rules, the company can ensure that legitimate traffic can access the API service. By attaching the web ACL to the ALB in front of the ECS tasks, the company can apply the web security rules to all requests that are forwarded by the load balancer. The other options are not correct because: Creating a new AWS WAF Bot Control implementation would not prevent SQL injection attacks from reaching the ECS API service. AWS WAF Bot Control is a feature that gives you visibility and control over common and pervasive bot traffic that can consume excess resources, skew metrics, cause downtime, or perform other undesired activities. However, it does not protect against SQL injection attacks, which are malicious attempts to execute unauthorized SQL statements against your database3. Creating a new AWS WAF web ACL to monitor the HTTP requests and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to the ALB in front of the ECS tasks would not prevent SQL injection attacks from reaching the ECS API service. Monitoring mode is a feature that enables you to evaluate how your rules would perform without actually blocking any requests. However, this mode does not provide any protection against attacks, as it only logs and counts requests that match your rules4. Creating a new AWS WAF web ACL and creating a new empty IP set in AWS WAF would not prevent SQL injection attacks from reaching the ECS API service. An IP set is a feature that enables you to specify a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks that you want to allow or block based on their source IP address. However, this approach would not be effective or efficient against SQL injection attacks, as it would require constantly updating the IP set with new IP addresses of attackers, and it would not block attackers who use proxies or VPNs.

        "explanation": "AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) is a service that minimizes downtime and data loss with fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications using affordable storage, minimal compute, and point-in-time recovery1. Users can set up AWS DRS on their source servers to initiate secure data replication to a staging area subnet in their AWS account, in the AWS Region they select. Users can then launch recovery instances on AWS within minutes, using the most up-to-date server state or a previous point in time. To configure a cloud backup of the application with AWS DRS, users need to create a VPC that has at least two public subnets, a virtual private gateway, and an internet gateway. A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where users can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define2. A public subnet is a subnet that has a route to an internet gateway3. A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection4. An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet. Users need to create at least two public subnets for redundancy and high availability. Users need to create a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC to enable VPN connectivity between the on-premises network and the target AWS network. Users need to create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC to enable internet access for the replication servers. To ensure that replication traffic does not travel through the public internet, users need to create an AWS Direct Connect connection and a Direct Connect gateway between the on-premises network and the target AWS network. AWS Direct Connect is a service that establishes a dedicated network connection from an on- premises network to one or more VPCs. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource that allows users to connect multiple VPCs across different Regions to their on-premises networks using one or more Direct Connect connections. Users need to create an AWS Direct Connect connection between their on- premises network and an AWS Region. Users need to create a Direct Connect gateway and associate it with their VPC and their Direct Connect connection. To ensure that the application is not accessible from the internet, users need to select the option to use private IP addresses for data replication during configuration of the replication servers. This option configures the replication servers with private IP addresses only, without assigning any public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses. This way, the replication servers can only communicate with other resources within the VPC or through VPN connections. Option A is incorrect because creating a VPC that has at least two private subnets, two NAT gateways, and a virtual private gateway is not necessary or cost- effective. A private subnet is a subnet that does not have a route to an internet gateway3. A NAT gateway is a highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating connections with those instances. Users do not need to create private subnets or NAT gateways for this use case, as they can use public subnets with private IP addresses for data replication. Option C is incorrect because creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the on-premises network and the target AWS network will not ensure that replication traffic does not travel through the public internet. A Site-to-Site VPN connection consists of two VPN tunnels between an on-premises customer Passing Certification Exams Made Easy visit - https://www.2PassEasy.com Welcome to download the Newest 2passeasy AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional dumps https://www.2passeasy.com/dumps/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional/ (300",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The company should create a resource-based IAM policy that includes conditions for specific DynamoDB attributes (fine-grained access control). The company should attach the policy to the DynamoDB table. In the marketing team’s account, the company should create an IAM role that has permissions to access the DynamoDB table in the finance team’s account. This solution will meet the requirements because a resource-based IAM policy is a policy that you attach to an AWS resource (such as a DynamoDB table) to control who can access that resource and what actions they can perform on it. You can use IAM policy conditions to specify fine-grained access control for DynamoDB items and attributes. For example, you can allow or deny access to specific attributes of all items in a table by matching on attribute names1. By creating a resource-based policy that allows access to only specific attributes of the DynamoDB table and attaching it to the table, the company can restrict access to confidential data. By creating an IAM role in the marketing team’s account that has permissions to access the DynamoDB table in the finance team’s account, the company can enable cross-account access. The other options are not correct because: Creating an SCP to grant the marketing team’s AWS account access to the specific attributes of the DynamoDB table would not work because SCPs are policies that you can use with AWS Organizations to manage permissions in your organization’s accounts. SCPs do not grant permissions; instead, they specify the maximum permissions that identities in an account can have2. SCPs cannot be used to specify fine-grained access control for DynamoDB items and attributes. Creating an IAM role in the finance team’s account by using IAM policy conditions for specific DynamoDB attributes and establishing trust with the marketing team’s account would not work because IAM roles are identities that you can create in your account that have specific permissions. You can use an IAM role to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don’t normally have access to your AWS resources3. However, creating an IAM role in the finance team’s account would not restrict access to specific attributes of the DynamoDB table; it would only allow cross-account access. The company would still need a resource- based policy attached to the table to enforce fine-grained access control. Creating an IAM role in the finance team’s account to access the DynamoDB table and using an IAM permissions boundary to limit the access to the specific attributes would not work because IAM permissions boundaries are policies that you use to delegate permissions management to other users. You can use permissions boundaries to limit the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (user or role)4. Permissions boundaries cannot be used to specify fine-grained access control for DynamoDB items and attributes.

        "explanation": "AWS Organizations is a service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. By creating a management account and inviting all the existing accounts to join the organization, the solutions architect can track and consolidate expenditures for all the accounts using AWS Cost Management tools such as AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets. An organizational unit (OU) is a group of accounts within an organization that can be used to apply policies and simplify management. A service control policy (SCP) is a type of policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. By creating an OU that includes all the development teams and applying an SCP that allows the creation of resources only in Regions that are in the United States, the solutions architect can ensure that the company meets its compliance requirements and avoids unwanted charges from other Regions. An IAM role is an identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. By creating an IAM role in the management account and allowing the finance team users to assume it, the solutions architect can give them access to view the Billing and Cost Management console without sharing credentials or creating additional users.

Then, deploying the API's Lambda functions as Zip packages and configuring the packages to use the Lambda layer would meet the requirements for simplifying the deployment and optimizing for code reuse. A Lambda layer is a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. It allows you to manage your in-development function code separately from your dependencies, this way you can easily update your dependencies without having to update your entire function code. By deploying the shared libraries and custom classes to a Docker image and uploading the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), it makes it easy to manage and version the dependencies. This way, the company can use the same version of the dependencies across different Lambda functions. By creating a Lambda layer that uses the Docker image as the source, the company can configure the API's Lambda functions to use the layer, reducing the need Passing Certification Exams Made Easy visit - https://www.2PassEasy.com Welcome to download the Newest 2passeasy AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional dumps https://www.2passeasy.com/dumps/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional/ (300",

An SCP (Service Control Policy) is a policy that you can use to set fine-grained permissions for your AWS accounts within your organization. You can use SCPs to set permissions for the root user of an account and to delegate permissions to IAM users and roles in the accounts. You can use SCPs to set permissions that allow or deny access to specific services, actions, and resources. To implement this solution, you would need to create an SCP that denies the ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress action when the value of the aws:SourceIp condition key is 0.0.0.0/0. This SCP would then be applied to the NonProd OU. This would ensure that any security group inbound rule that includes 0.0.0.0/0 as the source will be denied, thus meeting the requirement.

        "correct_answer": "CE",
        "explanation": "Option C is correct because leveraging Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda to ingest and process the raw data resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that simplifies the capture, processing, and storage of data streams at any scale. Kinesis Data Streams can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low latency. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda can be triggered by Kinesis Data Streams events and process the data records in real time. Lambda can also scale automatically based on the incoming data volume. By using Kinesis Data Streams and Lambda, the company can reduce the load on the API servers and improve the performance and scalability of the data ingestion and processing layer3 Option E is correct because re-architecting the database tier to use Amazon DynamoDB instead of an RDS MySQL DB instance resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value and document database that delivers single- digit millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB supports auto scaling, which automatically adjusts read and write capacity based on actual traffic patterns. DynamoDB also supports on-demand capacity mode, which instantly accommodates up to double the previous peak traffic on a table. By using DynamoDB instead of RDS MySQL DB instance, the company can eliminate high write latency and improve scalability and performance of the database tier.

Confirmation includes\nthe recipient's signature or a photo of the package with the recipient. The driver's handheld device uploads signatures and photos through FTP to a single Amazon\nEC2 instance. Each handheld device saves a file in a directory based on the signed-in user, and the file name matches the delivery number. The EC2 instance\nthen adds metadata to the file after querying a central database to pull delivery information. The file is then placed in Amazon S3 for archiving.\nAs the company expands, drivers report that the system is rejecting connections. The FTP server is having problems because of dropped connections and\nmemory issues. In response to these problems, a system engineer schedules a cron task to reboot the EC2 instance every 30 minutes. The billing team reports\nthat files are not always in the archive and that the central system is not always updated.\nA solutions architect needs to design a solution that maximizes scalability to ensure that the archive always receives the files and that systems are always\nupdated.

        "explanation": "Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL. - Create an Amazon Aurora Replica. - Use RDS Proxy in front of the database. - These options are correct because they address the requirement of reducing the failover time to less than 20 seconds. Migrating to Amazon Aurora MySQL and creating an Aurora replica can reduce the failover time to less than 20 seconds. Aurora has a built-in, fault-tolerant storage system that can automatically detect and repair failures. Additionally, Aurora has a feature called \"Aurora Global Database\" which allows you to create read-only replicas across multiple AWS regions which can further help to reduce the failover time. Creating an Aurora replica can also help to reduce the failover time as it can take over as the primary DB instance in case of a failure. Using RDS proxy can also help to reduce the failover time as it can route the queries to the healthy DB instance, it also helps to balance the load across multiple DB instances.",

The administrator must still attach identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to actually grant permissions.

        "explanation": "AWS Global Accelerator is a service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints (in this case, the Application Load Balancer) based on the health of the endpoints and network routing. It allows you to create an accelerator that directs traffic to multiple endpoint groups, one for each Region where the application is deployed. The accelerator uses the AWS global network to optimize the traffic routing to the healthy endpoint. By using Global Accelerator, the company can use a single static IP address for the apex domain, and traffic will be directed to the optimal endpoint based on the user's location, without the need for additional load balancers or routing policies.

To do this, the following steps are required: Upload static informational content to the S3 bucket. This will provide the source of the content that will be served to the visitors. Set the S3 bucket as a second origin in the original CloudFront distribution. Configure the distribution and the S3 bucket to use an origin access identity (OAI). This will allow CloudFront to access the S3 bucket securely and prevent public access to the bucket. During the weekly maintenance, edit the default cache behavior to use the S3 origin.

The other options are not correct because: Creating a new CloudFront distribution is not necessary and would require changing the alternate domain name configuration. Creating a cache behavior for the S3 origin on a new distribution would not work because the visitors would still access the original distribution using the alternate domain name.

        "explanation": "AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides real-time guidance to help users provision their resources following AWS best practices1. One of the Trusted Advisor checks is “Low Utilization Amazon EC2 Instances”, which identifies EC2 instances that appear to be underutilized based on CPU, network I/O, and disk I/O metrics1. This check can help users optimize the cost and size of their EC2 instances by recommending smaller or more appropriate instance types. AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of AWS resources and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of workloads2. Compute Optimizer supports four types of AWS resources: EC2 instances, EBS volumes, ECS services on AWS Fargate, and Lambda functions2. For EC2 instances, Compute Optimizer evaluates the vCPUs, memory, storage, and other specifications, as well as the CPU utilization, network in and out, disk read and write, and other utilization metrics of currently running instances3. It then recommends optimal instance types based on price-performance trade-offs. Option A is incorrect because purchasing AWS Business Support or AWS Enterprise Support for the account will not directly help with cost-optimization and sizing of EC2 instances. However, these support plans do provide access to more Trusted Advisor checks than the basic support plan1. Option C is incorrect because installing the Amazon CloudWatch agent and configuring memory metric collection on the EC2 instances will not provide any optimization recommendations by itself. However, memory metrics can be used by Compute Optimizer to enhance its recommendations if enabled3. Option E is incorrect because creating an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the AWS Regions, instance families, and operating systems of interest will not help with cost-optimization and sizing of EC2 instances. Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer lower prices on Amazon EC2 usage in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage for a 1- or 3-year term4. Savings Plans do not affect the configuration or utilization of EC2 instances.",

        "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because creating a Direct Connect gateway in the central account and creating an association proposal by using the Direct Connect gateway and the account ID for every virtual private gateway does not enable active-passive failover between the regions. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource that enables you to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface (VIF) to one or more VPCs in any AWS Region. A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of a VPN connection. You can associate a Direct Connect gateway with either a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. However, a Direct Connect gateway does not provide any load balancing or failover capabilities by itself1 Option B is correct because creating a Direct Connect gateway and a transit gateway in the central network account and attaching the transit gateway to the Direct Connect gateway by using a transit VIF meets the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. A transit VIF is a type of private VIF that you can use to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection to a transit gateway or a Direct Connect gateway. A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks. By using a transit VIF, you can route traffic between your on-premises network and multiple VPCs across different AWS accounts and Regions through a single connection23 Option C is incorrect because provisioning an internet gateway, attaching the internet gateway to subnets, and allowing internet traffic through the gateway does not meet the requirement of routing cloud resources to the internet through its on-premises data center. An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. By using an internet gateway, you are routing cloud resources directly to the internet, not through your on-premises data center. Option D is correct because sharing the transit gateway with other accounts and attaching VPCs to the transit gateway meets the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. You can share your transit gateway with other AWS accounts within the same organization by using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This allows you to centrally manage connectivity from multiple accounts without having to create individual peering connections between VPCs or duplicate network appliances in each account. You can attach VPCs from different accounts and Regions to your shared transit gateway and enable routing between them. Option E is incorrect because provisioning VPC peering as necessary does not meet the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account within a single Region. However, VPC peering does not allow you to route traffic from your on-premises network to your VPCs or between multiple Regions. You would need to create multiple VPN connections or Direct Connect connections for each VPC peering connection, which increases operational complexity and costs. Option F is correct because provisioning only private subnets, opening the necessary route on the transit gateway and customer gateway to allow outbound internet traffic from AWS to flow through NAT services that run in the data center meets the requirement of routing cloud resources to the internet through its on- premises data center. A private subnet is a subnet that’s associated with a route table that has no route to an internet gateway. Instances in a private subnet can communicate with other instances in the same VPC but cannot access resources on the internet directly. To enable outbound internet access from instances in private subnets, you can use NAT devices such as NAT gateways or NAT instances that are deployed in public subnets. A public subnet is a subnet that’s associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway. Alternatively, you can use your on-premises data center as a NAT device by configuring routes on your transit gateway and customer gateway that direct outbound internet traffic from your private subnets through your VPN connection or Direct Connect connection. This way, you can route cloud resources to the internet through your on-premises data center instead of using an internet gateway.

You also limit the role permissions to only read and write access to the productionapp bucket. Anyone granted permission to use the role can read and write to the productionapp bucket. Step 2: Grant access to the role Sign in as an administrator in the Development account and allow the AssumeRole action on the UpdateApp role in the Production account. So, recap, production account you create the policy for S3, and you set development account as a trusted entity.

        "explanation": "Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL. - Create an Amazon Aurora Replica. - Use RDS Proxy in front of the database. - These options are correct because they address the requirement of reducing the failover time to less than 20 seconds. Migrating to Amazon Aurora MySQL and creating an Aurora replica can reduce the failover time to less than 20 seconds. Aurora has a built-in, fault-tolerant storage system that can automatically detect and repair failures. Additionally, Aurora has a feature called \"Aurora Global Database\" which allows you to create read-only replicas across multiple AWS regions which can further help to reduce the failover time. Creating an Aurora replica can also help to reduce the failover time as it can take over as the primary DB instance in case of a failure. Using RDS proxy can also help to reduce the failover time as it can route the queries to the healthy DB instance, it also helps to balance the load across multiple DB instances.",

        "explanation": "Using an SQS queue to store events and invoke the Lambda function will decouple the third-party service calls and ensure that all the calls are eventually completed. SQS allows you to store messages in a queue and process them asynchronously, which eliminates the need for the application to wait for a response from the third-party service. The messages will be stored in the SQS queue until they are processed by the Lambda function, even if the Lambda function is currently unavailable or busy. This will ensure that all the calls are eventually completed, even if there are delays or errors. AWS Step Functions state machines can also be used to pass events to the Lambda function, but it would require additional management and configuration to set up the state machine, which would increase operational overhead. Amazon EventBridge rule can also be used to pass events to the Lambda function, but it would not provide the same level of decoupling and reliability as SQS. Using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to store events and Invoke the Lambda function, is similar to SQS, but SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service and SQS is a queue service. SNS is used for sending messages to multiple recipients, SQS is used for sending messages to a single recipient, so SQS is more appropriate for this use case.

        "explanation": "The company should configure a cross-Region read replica for the RDS database in the new Region. The company should change the Route 53 record to latency- based routing to connect to the API Gateway API. This solution will meet the requirements because a cross-Region read replica is a feature that enables you to create a MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server read replica in a different Region from the source DB instance. You can use cross-Region read replicas to improve availability and disaster recovery, scale out globally, or migrate an existing database to a new Region1. By creating a cross-Region read replica for the RDS database in the new Region, the company can have a standby copy of its primary database that can serve read-only traffic from users in Europe. A latency-based routing policy is a feature that enables you to route traffic based on the latency between your users and your resources. You can use latency-based routing to route traffic to the resource that provides the best latency2. By changing the Route 53 record to latency-based routing, the company can minimize latency for users who download reports by connecting them to the API Gateway API in the Region that provides the best response time. The other options are not correct because: Using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the primary database in the original Region to the database in the new Region would not be as cost-effective or simple as using a cross-Region read replica. AWS DMS is a service that enables you to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. You can use AWS DMS to perform one-time migrations or continuous data replication with high availability and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse3. However, AWS DMS requires more configuration and management than creating a cross-Region read replica, which is fully Passing Certification Exams Made Easy visit - https://www.surepassexam.com Recommend!!

        "correct_answer": "CE",
        "explanation": "Option C is correct because leveraging Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda to ingest and process the raw data resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that simplifies the capture, processing, and storage of data streams at any scale. Kinesis Data Streams can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low latency. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda can be triggered by Kinesis Data Streams events and process the data records in real time. Lambda can also scale automatically based on the incoming data volume. By using Kinesis Data Streams and Lambda, the company can reduce the load on the API servers and improve the performance and scalability of the data ingestion and processing layer3 Option E is correct because re-architecting the database tier to use Amazon DynamoDB instead of an RDS MySQL DB instance resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value and document database that delivers single- digit millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB supports auto scaling, which automatically adjusts read and write capacity based on actual traffic patterns. DynamoDB also supports on-demand capacity mode, which instantly accommodates up to double the previous peak traffic on a table. By using DynamoDB instead of RDS MySQL DB instance, the company can eliminate high write latency and improve scalability and performance of the database tier.

        "correct_answer": "BC",
        "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because creating an SCP to set a fixed monthly account usage limit is not possible. SCPs are policies that specify the services and actions that users and roles can use in the member accounts of an AWS Organization. SCPs cannot enforce budget limits or prevent users from launching costly services or running services unnecessarily1 Option B is correct because using AWS Budgets to create a fixed monthly budget for each developer’s account as part of the account creation process meets the requirement of giving developers a fixed monthly budget to limit their AWS costs. AWS Budgets allows you to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. You can create budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount2 Option C is correct because creating an SCP to deny access to costly services and components meets the requirement of ensuring that developers are not launching costly services or running services unnecessarily. SCPs can restrict access to certain AWS services or actions based on conditions such as region, resource tags, or request time. For example, an SCP can deny access to Amazon Redshift clusters or Amazon EC2 instances with certain instance types1 Option D is incorrect because creating an IAM policy to deny access to costly services and components is not sufficient to meet the requirement of ensuring that developers are not launching costly services or running services unnecessarily. IAM policies can only control access to resources within a single AWS account. If developers have multiple accounts or can create new accounts, they can bypass the IAM policy restrictions. SCPs can apply across multiple accounts within an AWS Organization and prevent users from creating new accounts that do not comply with the SCP rules3 Option E is incorrect because creating an AWS Budgets alert action to terminate services when the budgeted amount is reached is not possible. AWS Budgets alert actions can only perform one of the following actions: apply an IAM policy, apply an SCP, or send a notification through Amazon SNS. AWS Budgets alert actions cannot terminate services directly. Option F is correct because creating an AWS Budgets alert action to send an Amazon SNS notification when the budgeted amount is reached and invoking an AWS Lambda function to terminate all services meets the requirement of giving developers a fixed monthly budget to limit their AWS costs. AWS Budgets alert actions can send notifications through Amazon SNS when a budget threshold is breached.

This is the most efficient solution as it will not require additional steps such as analyzing CloudTrail events or manually creating and testing an IAM policy. You can use the IAM policy simulator to generate an IAM policy for an IAM role by specifying the role and the API actions and resources that the application or service requires. The simulator will then generate an IAM policy that grants the least privilege access to those actions and resources. Once you have generated an IAM policy using the simulator, you can replace the existing SecretsManagerReadWnte policy that is attached to the IAM role with the newly generated policy. This will ensure that the application or service has the least privilege access to the Secrets Manager actions that it requires. You can access the IAM policy simulator through the IAM console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.

Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced data protection and minimize downtime by automatically failing over to a standby replica in another Availability Zone in case of a planned or unplanned outage4 Option F is correct because creating a replication group for the ElastiCache for Redis cluster and enabling Multi-AZ on the cluster can improve the availability and fault tolerance of the in-memory data store. A replication group consists of a primary node and up to five read-only replica nodes that are synchronized with the primary node using asynchronous replication.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables users to send messages to multiple subscribers1. Users can send event details to an Amazon SNS topic and configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber to the SNS topic to process the events. Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources2. Users can add an on-failure destination to the function and set an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the target. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables users to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications3. This way, if a processing error occurs, the event will move into the separate queue for review. Option B is incorrect because publishing events to an Amazon SQS queue and creating an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group will not have the ability to scale in and out based on the number of events that the solution receives. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Auto Scaling is a feature that helps users maintain application availability and allows them to scale their EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions they define. However, for this use case, using SQS and EC2 will not take advantage of the serverless capabilities of Lambda and SNS. Option C is incorrect because writing events to an Amazon DynamoDB table and configuring a DynamoDB stream for the table will not have the ability to move events into a separate queue for review if a processing error occurs. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB Streams is a feature that captures data modification events in DynamoDB tables. Users can configure the stream to invoke a Lambda function, but they cannot configure an on-failure destination for the function. Option D is incorrect because publishing events to an Amazon EventBridge event bus and setting an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the event bus target will not have the ability to move events into a separate queue for review if a processing error occurs. Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications with data from a variety of sources. An ALB is a load balancer that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. Users can configure EventBridge to retry events, but they cannot configure an on-failure destination for the ALB.",
