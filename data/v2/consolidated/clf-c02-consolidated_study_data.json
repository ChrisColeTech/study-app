        "explanation": "AWS Application Discovery Service is a service that helps you plan your migration to the AWS Cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your on- premises servers and databases. This data includes information such as the hostname, IP address, and MAC address of each server, as well as the performance metrics, network connections, and processes running on them. You can use AWS Application Discovery Service to discover your on-premises inventory, map the dependencies between servers and applications, and estimate the cost and effort of migrating to AWS. You can also export the data to other AWS services, such as AWS Migration Hub and AWS Database Migration Service, to support your migration tasks. AWS Application Discovery Service offers two ways of performing discovery: agentless discovery and agent-based discovery. Agentless discovery uses a virtual appliance that you deploy on your VMware vCenter to collect data from your virtual machines and hosts. Agent-based discovery uses an agent that you install on each of your physical or virtual servers to collect data. You can choose the method that best suits your environment and needs. AWS DataSync is a service that helps you transfer data between your on-premises storage and AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. AWS DataSync does not collect information about your on- premises infrastructure, but rather focuses on optimizing the data transfer speed, security, and reliability. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your applications from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. AWS Application Migration Service does not collect information about your on- premises infrastructure, but rather uses a lightweight agent to replicate your servers as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and launch them as EC2 instances on AWS. AWS Database Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your databases from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS, either as a one-time migration or as a continuous replication. AWS Database Migration Service does not collect information about your on-premises infrastructure, but rather uses a source and a target endpoint to connect to your databases and transfer the data.

        "correct_answer": "AE",
        "explanation": "The security best practices that should be followed are A and E. * A. Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job. This is an example of the principle of least privilege, which means giving the minimum permissions necessary to achieve a task. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users, groups, roles, and policies that grant fine- grained access to AWS resources12. * E. Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length. This is a basic security measure that helps prevent brute-force attacks or guessing of passwords. A longer password is harder to crack than a shorter one. You can use IAM to configure a password policy that enforces a minimum password length, as well as other requirements such as complexity, expiration, and history34. * B. Share the AWS account root user credentials with the developer. This is a bad practice that should be avoided. The root user has full access to all AWS resources and services, and can perform sensitive actions such as changing billing information, closing the account, or deleting all resources. Sharing the root user credentials exposes your account to potential compromise or misuse. You should never share your root user credentials with anyone, and use them only for account administration tasks5 . * C. Add the developer to the administrator’s group in IAM. This is also a bad practice that should be avoided. The administrator’s group has full access to all AWS resources and services, which is more than what a developer needs to perform their job. Adding the developer to the administrator’s group violates the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You should create a custom group for the developer that grants only the necessary permissions for their role12. * D. Configure a password policy that ensures the developer’s password cannot be changed. This is another bad practice that should be avoided. Preventing the developer from changing their password reduces their ability to protect their credentials and comply with security policies. For example, if the developer’s password is compromised, they cannot change it to prevent further unauthorized access. Or if the company requires periodic password rotation, they cannot update their password to meet this requirement. You should allow the developer to change their password as needed, and enforce a password policy that sets reasonable rules for password management34.",

        "explanation": "The cost of application software licenses is the company’s direct responsibility when it migrates its IT infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. Application software licenses are the agreements that grant users the right to use specific software products, such as operating systems, databases, or applications. Depending on the type and terms of the license, users may need to pay a fee to the software vendor or provider to use the software legally and access its features and updates. When users migrate their IT infrastructure to the AWS Cloud, they can choose to buy new licenses from AWS, bring their own licenses (BYOL), or use a combination of both. However, regardless of the option they choose, they are still responsible for complying with the license terms and paying the license fees to the software vendor or provider. AWS does not charge users for the application software licenses they bring or buy, but only for the AWS resources they use to run their applications. Therefore, the cost of application software licenses is the only cost among the options that is the company’s direct responsibility. The other costs are either included in the AWS service fees or covered by AWS.

        "explanation": "AWS Budgets and Amazon CloudWatch are two AWS services or tools that the company can use to receive a notification when a specific AWS cost threshold is reached. AWS Budgets allows users to set custom budgets to track their costs and usage, and respond quickly to alerts received from email or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications if they exceed their threshold. Users can create cost budgets with fixed or variable target amounts, and configure their notifications for actual or forecasted spend. Users can also set up custom actions to run automatically or through an approval process when a budget target is exceeded. For example, users could automatically apply a custom IAM policy that denies them the ability to provision additional resources within an account. Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors applications, responds to performance changes, optimizes resource use, and provides insights into operational health. Users can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables they can measure for their resources and applications. Users can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources they are monitoring when a threshold is breached. Users can use CloudWatch to monitor their AWS costs and usage by creating billing alarms that send notifications when their estimated charges exceed a specified threshold amount. Users can also use CloudWatch to monitor their Reserved Instance (RI) or Savings Plans utilization and coverage, and receive notifications when they fall below a certain level.

You can use Spot Instances for various stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications such as big data, containerized workloads, high-performance computing (HPC), and test & development workloads. Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as batch image rendering applications1. On-Demand Instances are instances that let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs2. Reserved Instances are instances that provide you with a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. In exchange, you select a term and make an upfront payment to reserve a certain amount of compute capacity for that term3. Dedicated Instances are instances that run in a VPC on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer. Your Dedicated Instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts4.",

        "explanation": "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that enables you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports several platform configurations for Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker web applications that can run on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can also use Elastic Beanstalk to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS with the least operational effort. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker containerized applications on AWS. However, it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to define your application architecture and the specifications of the containers that run it. Amazon Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers everything you need to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. It is designed for developers who have little or no prior cloud experience and want to launch and manage applications on AWS with minimal complexity. However, it does not support MySQL databases, and it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to configure your VM and database settings. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS, but it requires the most operational effort, as you need to provision, monitor, and manage your EC2 instances and database.",

The platform perspective helps you build an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform, modernize existing workloads, and implement new cloud-native solutions1. The other five capabilities are: ? Platform architecture – Establish and maintain guidelines, principles, patterns, and guardrails for your cloud environment. ? Platform engineering – Build a compliant multi-account cloud environment with enhanced security features, and packaged, reusable cloud products. ? Platform operations – Manage and optimize your cloud environment with automation, monitoring, and incident response. ? Application development – Develop and deploy cloud-native applications using modern architectures and best practices. ? Application migration – Migrate your existing applications to the cloud using proven methodologies and tools. Performance and capacity management, infrastructure protection, and change and release management are not capabilities of the platform perspective. They are part of the operations perspective, which helps you achieve operational excellence in the cloud2. The operations perspective comprises six capabilities: ? Performance and capacity management – Monitor and optimize the performance and capacity of your cloud workloads. ? Infrastructure protection – Protect your cloud infrastructure from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and data breaches. ? Change and release management – Manage changes and releases to your cloud workloads using automation and governance. ? Configuration management – Manage the configuration of your cloud resources and applications using automation and version control. ? Incident management – Respond to incidents affecting your cloud workloads using best practices and tools. ? Service continuity management – Ensure the availability and resilience of your cloud workloads using backup, recovery, and disaster recovery strategies.",

It allows you to launch virtual servers, called instances, with different configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources. AWS Compute Optimizer analyzes the specifications and utilization metrics of your Amazon EC2 instances and generates recommendations for optimal instance types that can reduce costs and improve performance. You can view the recommendations on the AWS Compute Optimizer console or the Amazon EC2 console12. Amazon RDS, Amazon Lightsail, and AWS Step Functions are not supported by AWS Compute Optimizer. Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that lets you set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon Lightsail is an easy- to-use cloud platform that offers everything you need to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly3 .",

        "explanation": "Agility in AWS Cloud computing means the ability to rapidly provision and deprovision AWS resources as needed, and the ability to experiment quickly with new ideas and solutions. Agility helps businesses to respond to changing customer demands, market opportunities, and competitive threats, and to innovate faster and cheaper. Agility also reduces the risk of failure, as businesses can test and validate their assumptions before committing to large-scale deployments. Some of the benefits of agility in AWS Cloud computing are: ? The speed at which AWS resources are implemented: AWS provides a variety of services and tools that allow you to create, configure, and launch AWS resources in minutes, using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Software Development Kits (AWS SDKs), or the AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to define your AWS resources as code using familiar programming languages, and synthesize them into AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Service Catalog to create and manage standardized portfolios of AWS resources that meet your organizational policies and best practices. AWS also offers on-demand, pay-as-you-go pricing models, so you only pay for the resources you use, and you can scale them up or down as your needs change12345 ? The ability to experiment quickly: AWS enables you to experiment quickly with new ideas and solutions, without having to invest in upfront capital or long-term commitments. You can use AWS to create and test multiple prototypes, hypotheses, and minimum viable products (MVPs) in parallel, and measure their performance and feedback. You can also use AWS to leverage existing services and solutions, such as AWS Marketplace, AWS Solutions, and AWS Quick Starts, that can help you accelerate your innovation process. AWS also supports a culture of experimentation and learning, by providing tools and resources for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), testing, monitoring, and analytics.

        "explanation": "The architecture deployment model that the company should use to meet this requirement is A. Multi-Region. A multi-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple geographic regions. A multi-region deployment model enables a company to achieve global reach, high availability, disaster recovery, and performance optimization. By deploying an application in multiple regions, a company can serve customers from the nearest region, reduce latency, increase redundancy, and comply with data sovereignty regulations12. A single-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single geographic region. A single-region deployment model is simpler and cheaper than a multi-region deployment model, but it has limited scalability, availability, and performance. A single-region deployment model may not be suitable for a company that wants to deploy an application globally, as it may face challenges such as network latency, regional outages, or regulatory compliance12. A multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple isolated locations within a single region. An Availability Zone is a physically separate location within an AWS Region that has independent power, cooling, and networking. A multi- AZ deployment model enhances the availability and durability of an application by providing redundancy and fault tolerance within a region34. A single-AZ deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single Availability Zone. A single-AZ deployment model is the simplest and most cost-effective option, but it has no redundancy or fault tolerance. A single-AZ deployment model may not be suitable for a company that wants to deploy an application globally, as it may face challenges such as network latency, regional outages, or regulatory compliance34.

It also involves associating the transformation initiatives with key stakeholders and measurable business outcomes1. ? Align phase: This phase focuses on identifying capability gaps across six perspectives: business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations. It also involves identifying cross-organizational dependencies and surfacing stakeholder concerns and challenges. The goal of this phase is to create strategies for improving the cloud readiness, ensure stakeholder alignment, and facilitate relevant organizational change management activities1. ? Launch phase: This phase focuses on delivering pilot initiatives in production and demonstrating incremental business value. Pilots should be highly impactful and influence future direction. The customer should learn from the pilots and adjust their approach before scaling to full production1. ?

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Amazon EC2 instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content. It can also be used to store temporary data that you replicate across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. An instance store consists of one or more instance store volumes exposed as block devices. The size of an instance store as well as the number of devices available varies by instance type and instance size. The virtual devices for instance store volumes are ephemeral[0-23]. Instance types that support one instance store volume have ephemeral0. Instance types that support two or more instance store volumes have ephemeral0, ephemeral1, and so on. Instance store pricing Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance’s usage cost. The data on an instance store volume persists even if the instance is rebooted. However, the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. When the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, every block of the instance store volume is cryptographically erased. Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data. If you need to retain the data stored on an instance store volume beyond the lifetime of the instance, you need to manually copy that data to more persistent storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system. There are some events that can result in your data not persisting throughout the lifetime of the instance. The following table indicates whether data on instance store volumes is persisted during specific events, for both virtualized and bare metal instances1.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The trade of infrastructure expenses for operating expenses is one of the benefits of the AWS Cloud. By moving to the AWS Cloud, the company can avoid the upfront costs of purchasing and maintaining on-premises infrastructure, such as servers, storage, network, and software. Instead, the company can pay only for the AWS resources and services that they use, as they use them. This reduces the risk and complexity of planning and managing IT infrastructure, and allows the company to focus on innovation and growth. Increased speed to market, massive economies of scale, and the ability to go global in minutes are also benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they are not the best ones to describe this scenario. Increased speed to market means that the company can launch new products and services faster by using AWS services and tools. Massive economies of scale means that the company can benefit from the lower costs and higher performance that AWS achieves by operating at a large scale. The ability to go global in minutes means that the company can deploy their applications and data in multiple regions and availability zones around the world to reach their customers faster and improve performance and reliability5",

        "explanation": "AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a website or application by overwhelming it with a large volume of traffic from multiple sources. AWS Shield provides two tiers of protection: Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard is automatically enabled for all AWS customers at no additional cost. It protects your AWS resources, such as Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53, from the most common and frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks. AWS Shield Advanced is an optional paid service that provides additional protection for your AWS resources and applications, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. AWS Shield Advanced offers enhanced detection and mitigation capabilities, 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT), real-time visibility and reporting, and cost protection against DDoS-related spikes in your AWS bill12 References: AWS Shield, What is a DDOS Attack & How to Protect Your Site Against One",

AWS Snowmobile is a service that allows you to migrate large amounts of data to AWS using a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container that can store up to 100 petabytes of data. AWS Snowmobile is designed for situations where you need to move massive amounts of data to the cloud in a fast, secure, and cost-effective way. AWS Snowmobile has the least possible operational overhead because it eliminates the need to buy, configure, or manage hundreds or thousands of storage devices12. AWS Snowball Edge is a service that allows you to migrate data to AWS using a physical device that can store up to 80 terabytes of data and has compute and storage capabilities to run applications on the device. AWS Snowball Edge is suitable for situations where you have limited or intermittent network connectivity, or where bandwidth costs are high. However, AWS Snowball Edge has more operational overhead than AWS Snowmobile because you need to request multiple devices and transfer your data onto them using the client3. AWS Data Exchange is a service that allows you to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. AWS Data Exchange is not a data migration service, but rather a data marketplace that enables data providers and data consumers to exchange data sets securely and efficiently4. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a service that helps migrate databases to AWS. AWS DMS does not migrate file storage data, but rather supports various database platforms and engines as sources and targets5.

Savings Plans are flexible plans that offer significant discounts on AWS compute usage, such as EC2, Lambda, and Fargate. The company can choose from two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and apply to any eligible compute usage, regardless of instance family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy. EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide more savings and apply to a specific instance family within a region. The company can select the amount of compute usage per hour (e.g., $10/hour) that they want to commit to for the duration of the plan (1 year or 3 years). The company will pay the discounted Savings Plan rate for the amount of usage that matches their commitment, and the regular on-demand rate for any usage beyond that",

        "explanation": "Security groups are the AWS service or feature that can be used to apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances. Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more instances. Customers can create security groups and add rules that reflect the role of the instance that is associated with the security group. For example, a web server instance needs security group rules that allow inbound HTTP and HTTPS access, while a database instance needs rules that allow access for the type of database12. Security groups are stateful, meaning that the responses to allowed inbound traffic are also allowed, regardless of the outbound rules1. Customers can assign multiple security groups to an instance, and the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules1. Network ACLs are another AWS service or feature that can be used to control the traffic for a subnet. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that they allow. Therefore, customers must add rules for both inbound and outbound traffic3. Network ACLs are applied at the subnet level, not at the instance level. AWS Trusted Advisor is an AWS service that provides best practice recommendations for security, performance, cost optimization, and fault tolerance. AWS Trusted Advisor does not apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances, but it can help customers identify security gaps and improve their security posture4. AWS WAF is an AWS service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and bot attacks. AWS WAF does not apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances, but it can be integrated with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Application Load Balancer.",

        "explanation": "AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a managed and automated service that helps you migrate your databases from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS, either as a one-time migration or as a continuous replication. AWS DMS supports migration between 20-plus database and analytics engines, such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. AWS DMS also provides schema conversion and validation tools, as well as monitoring and security features. AWS DMS is a cost-effective and reliable solution for database migration, as you only pay for the compute resources and additional log storage used during the migration process, and you can minimize the downtime and data loss with Multi-AZ and ongoing replication12 To migrate a PostgreSQL database from on-premises to Amazon RDS using AWS DMS, you need to perform the following steps: ? Create an AWS DMS replication instance in the same AWS Region as your target Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance. The replication instance is a server that runs the AWS DMS replication software and connects to your source and target endpoints. You can choose the instance type, storage, and network settings based on your migration requirements3 ? Create a source endpoint that points to your on-premises PostgreSQL database. You need to provide the connection details, such as the server name, port, database name, user name, and password. You also need to specify the engine name as postgres and the SSL mode as required4 ? Create a target endpoint that points to your Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance. You need to provide the connection details, such as the server name, port, database name, user name, and password. You also need to specify the engine name as postgres and the SSL mode as verify-full. ? Create a migration task that defines the migration settings and options, such as the replication instance, the source and target endpoints, the migration type (full load, full load and change data capture, or change data capture only), the table mappings, the task settings, and the task monitoring role. You can also use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert your source schema to the target schema and apply it to the target endpoint before or after creating the migration task. ? Start the migration task and monitor its progress and status using the AWS DMS console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS DMS API. You can also use AWS CloudFormation to automate the creation and execution of the migration task. The other options are not suitable for migrating a PostgreSQL database from on-premises to Amazon RDS. Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool is a tool that helps you assess your readiness for cloud adoption based on six dimensions: business, people, process, platform, operations, and security. It does not perform any database migration tasks. AWS Migration Hub is a service that helps you track and manage the progress of your application migrations across multiple AWS and partner services, such as AWS DMS, AWS Application Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, and CloudEndure Migration. It does not perform any database migration tasks itself, but rather integrates with other migration services. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your applications from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. It does not support database migration, but rather replicates your servers as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and launches them as EC2 instances on AWS.

        "explanation": "An internet gateway is a service that allows for internet traffic to enter into a VPC. Otherwise, a VPC is completely segmented off and then the only way to get to it is potentially through a VPN connection rather than through internet connection. An internet gateway is a logical connection between an AWS VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic1. An internet gateway enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances) to connect to the internet if the resource has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate a connection to resources in your subnet using the public IPv4 address or IPv6 address2. An internet gateway also provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic. For communication using IPv4, the internet gateway also performs network address translation (NAT). For communication using IPv6, NAT is not needed because IPv6 addresses are public2. To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC using an internet gateway, you must create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC, add a route to your subnet’s route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway, ensure that instances in your subnet have a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, and ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the desired internet traffic to flow to and from your instance2.

        "explanation": "EC2 Instance Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer discounted hourly rates on Amazon EC2 instance usage for a 1 or 3 year term. EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide savings up to 72% off On-Demand rates, in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family in a chosen AWS Region (for example, M5 in Virginia). These plans automatically apply to usage regardless of size (for example, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, etc.), OS (for example, Windows, Linux, etc.), and tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default) within the specified family in a Region. With an EC2 Instance Savings Plan, you can change your instance size within the instance family (for example, from c5.xlarge to c5.2xlarge) or the operating system (for example, from Windows to Linux), or move from Dedicated tenancy to Default and continue to receive the discounted rate provided by your EC2 Instance Savings Plan4567.

        "explanation": "Rightsizing is the cloud concept that is demonstrated by using AWS Compute Optimizer. Rightsizing is the process of adjusting the type and size of your cloud resources to match the optimal performance and cost for your workloads. AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon ECS services on AWS Fargate. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. AWS Compute Optimizer uses machine learning to analyze your historical utilization data and compare it with the most cost-effective AWS alternatives. You can use the recommendations to evaluate the trade-offs between cost and performance, and decide when to move or resize your resources to achieve the best results.

Cloud fluency is the ability of the workforce to understand the benefits, challenges, and best practices of cloud computing, and to apply them to their roles and responsibilities. Cloud fluency helps the organization to adopt a cloud mindset, culture, and skills, and to leverage the full potential of the cloud. Cloud fluency can be achieved through various methods, such as training, certification, mentoring, coaching, and hands-on experience. Cloud fluency is one of the four capabilities of the people perspective, along with culture, organizational structure, and leadership. The other three capabilities belong to different perspectives of the AWS CAF. Data architecture is a capability of the platform perspective, which helps you design and implement data solutions that meet your business and technical requirements. Event management is a capability of the operations perspective, which helps you monitor and respond to events that affect the availability, performance, and security of your cloud resources. Strategic partnership is a capability of the business perspective, which helps you establish and maintain relationships with external stakeholders, such as customers, partners, suppliers, and regulators, to create value and achieve your business goals.

        "explanation": "According to security best practices, the best way to give an Amazon EC2 instance access to an Amazon S3 bucket is to have the EC2 instance assume a role to obtain the privileges to upload the file. A role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don’t normally have access to your AWS resources. For example, you can create a role that allows EC2 instances to access S3 buckets, and then attach the role to the EC2 instance. This way, the EC2 instance can assume the role and obtain temporary security credentials to access the S3 bucket. This method is more secure and scalable than storing or hardcoding IAM user credentials on the EC2 instance, as it avoids the risk of exposing or compromising the credentials. It also allows you to manage the permissions centrally and dynamically, and to audit the access using AWS CloudTrail. For more information on how to create and use roles for EC2 instances, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances1 The other options are not recommended for security reasons. Hardcoding or storing IAM user credentials on the EC2 instance is a bad practice, as it exposes the credentials to potential attackers or unauthorized users who can access the instance or the application code. It also makes it difficult to rotate or revoke the credentials, and to track the usage of the credentials. Modifying the S3 bucket policy to allow any service to upload to it at any time is also a bad practice, as it opens the bucket to potential data breaches, data loss, or data corruption. It also violates the principle of least privilege, which states that you should grant only the minimum permissions necessary for a task.

By providing local access to AWS managed infrastructure, AWS Outposts enables customers to build and run applications on premises using the same programming interfaces as in AWS Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower latency and local data processing needs. An Outpost is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer site. AWS operates, monitors, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region. You can create subnets on your Outpost and specify them when you create AWS resources such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, ECS clusters, and RDS instances. Instances in Outpost subnets communicate with other instances in the AWS Region using private IP addresses, all within the same VPC. Outposts solutions allow you to extend and run native AWS services on premises, and is available in a variety of form factors, from 1U and 2U Outposts servers to 42U Outposts racks, and multiple rack deployments. With AWS Outposts, you can run some AWS services locally and connect to a broad range of services available in the local AWS Region2. AWS Outposts is a hybrid cloud deployment model that uses AWS Outposts as part of the application deployment infrastructure. Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud services with orchestration between the platforms. Hybrid cloud provides businesses with greater flexibility, more deployment options, and optimized costs. By using AWS Outposts, customers can benefit from the fully managed infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools of AWS on premises, while still having access to the full range of AWS services available in the Region for a truly consistent hybrid experience3.

        "explanation": "AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). AWS Fargate allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. With AWS Fargate, you only pay for the compute resources you use to run your containers, and you don’t need to worry about scaling, patching, securing, or maintaining the underlying infrastructure. AWS Fargate simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, and enables you to focus on building and running your applications instead of managing the infrastructure.

        "explanation": "The solution that meets the requirement of the company that runs a database on Amazon Aurora in the us-east-1 Region and has a disaster recovery requirement that the database be available in another Region with minimal disruption to the database operations is to deploy Aurora cross-Region read replicas. Aurora cross- Region read replicas are secondary Aurora clusters that are created in a different AWS Region from the primary Aurora cluster, and are kept in sync with the primary cluster using physical replication. The company can use Aurora cross-Region read replicas to improve the availability and durability of the database, as well as to reduce the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in case of a regional disaster. Performing an Aurora Multi-AZ deployment, creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region, and deploying Aurora Replicas are not the best solutions for this requirement. An Aurora Multi-AZ deployment is a configuration that creates one or more Aurora Replicas within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides automatic failover in case of an Availability Zone outage. However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery. Creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region is a manual process that requires stopping the database, creating the snapshots, copying them to the target Region, and restoring them to a new Aurora cluster. This process can cause significant downtime and data loss. Deploying Aurora Replicas is a configuration that creates one or more secondary Aurora clusters within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides read scaling and high availability. However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery.",
