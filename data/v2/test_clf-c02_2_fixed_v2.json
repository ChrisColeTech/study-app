      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "AWS Application Discovery Service is a service that helps you plan your migration to the AWS Cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your on- premises servers and databases. This data includes information such as the hostname, IP address, and MAC address of each server, as well as the performance metrics, network connections, and processes running on them. You can use AWS Application Discovery Service to discover your on-premises inventory, map the dependencies between servers and applications, and estimate the cost and effort of migrating to AWS. You can also export the data to other AWS services, such as AWS Migration Hub and AWS Database Migration Service, to support your migration tasks. AWS Application Discovery Service offers two ways of performing discovery: agentless discovery and agent-based discovery. Agentless discovery uses a virtual appliance that you deploy on your VMware vCenter to collect data from your virtual machines and hosts. Agent-based discovery uses an agent that you install on each of your physical or virtual servers to collect data. You can choose the method that best suits your environment and needs. AWS DataSync is a service that helps you transfer data between your on-premises storage and AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. AWS DataSync does not collect information about your on- premises infrastructure, but rather focuses on optimizing the data transfer speed, security, and reliability. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your applications from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. AWS Application Migration Service does not collect information about your on- premises infrastructure, but rather uses a lightweight agent to replicate your servers as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and launch them as EC2 instances on AWS. AWS Database Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your databases from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS, either as a one-time migration or as a continuous replication. AWS Database Migration Service does not collect information about your on-premises infrastructure, but rather uses a source and a target endpoint to connect to your databases and transfer the data.

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "AE",
      "explanation": "The security best practices that should be followed are A and E. * A. Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job. This is an example of the principle of least privilege, which means giving the minimum permissions necessary to achieve a task. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users, groups, roles, and policies that grant fine- grained access to AWS resources12. * E. Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length. This is a basic security measure that helps prevent brute-force attacks or guessing of passwords. A longer password is harder to crack than a shorter one. You can use IAM to configure a password policy that enforces a minimum password length, as well as other requirements such as complexity, expiration, and history34. * B. Share the AWS account root user credentials with the developer. This is a bad practice that should be avoided. The root user has full access to all AWS resources and services, and can perform sensitive actions such as changing billing information, closing the account, or deleting all resources. Sharing the root user credentials exposes your account to potential compromise or misuse. You should never share your root user credentials with anyone, and use them only for account administration tasks5 . * C. Add the developer to the administrator’s group in IAM. This is also a bad practice that should be avoided. The administrator’s group has full access to all AWS resources and services, which is more than what a developer needs to perform their job. Adding the developer to the administrator’s group violates the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You should create a custom group for the developer that grants only the necessary permissions for their role12. * D. Configure a password policy that ensures the developer’s password cannot be changed. This is another bad practice that should be avoided. Preventing the developer from changing their password reduces their ability to protect their credentials and comply with security policies. For example, if the developer’s password is compromised, they cannot change it to prevent further unauthorized access. Or if the company requires periodic password rotation, they cannot update their password to meet this requirement. You should allow the developer to change their password as needed, and enforce a password policy that sets reasonable rules for password management34.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The cost of application software licenses is the company’s direct responsibility when it migrates its IT infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. Application software licenses are the agreements that grant users the right to use specific software products, such as operating systems, databases, or applications. Depending on the type and terms of the license, users may need to pay a fee to the software vendor or provider to use the software legally and access its features and updates. When users migrate their IT infrastructure to the AWS Cloud, they can choose to buy new licenses from AWS, bring their own licenses (BYOL), or use a combination of both. However, regardless of the option they choose, they are still responsible for complying with the license terms and paying the license fees to the software vendor or provider. AWS does not charge users for the application software licenses they bring or buy, but only for the AWS resources they use to run their applications. Therefore, the cost of application software licenses is the only cost among the options that is the company’s direct responsibility. The other costs are either included in the AWS service fees or covered by AWS.

      "explanation": "AWS Budgets and Amazon CloudWatch are two AWS services or tools that the company can use to receive a notification when a specific AWS cost threshold is reached. AWS Budgets allows users to set custom budgets to track their costs and usage, and respond quickly to alerts received from email or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications if they exceed their threshold. Users can create cost budgets with fixed or variable target amounts, and configure their notifications for actual or forecasted spend. Users can also set up custom actions to run automatically or through an approval process when a budget target is exceeded. For example, users could automatically apply a custom IAM policy that denies them the ability to provision additional resources within an account. Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors applications, responds to performance changes, optimizes resource use, and provides insights into operational health. Users can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables they can measure for their resources and applications. Users can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources they are monitoring when a threshold is breached. Users can use CloudWatch to monitor their AWS costs and usage by creating billing alarms that send notifications when their estimated charges exceed a specified threshold amount. Users can also use CloudWatch to monitor their Reserved Instance (RI) or Savings Plans utilization and coverage, and receive notifications when they fall below a certain level.

Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as batch image rendering applications1. On-Demand Instances are instances that let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs2. Reserved Instances are instances that provide you with a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. In exchange, you select a term and make an upfront payment to reserve a certain amount of compute capacity for that term3. Dedicated Instances are instances that run in a VPC on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer.

You can also use Elastic Beanstalk to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS with the least operational effort. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker containerized applications on AWS. However, it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to define your application architecture and the specifications of the containers that run it.

      "explanation": "Network ACLs (network access control lists) are an AWS service or feature that provides the functionality of applying security rules to a subnet for EC2 instances. A subnet is a logical partition of an IP network within a VPC (virtual private cloud). A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where the company can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define. A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more subnets. The company can use network ACLs to allow or deny traffic based on protocol, port, or source and destination IP address. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that flows through them. Therefore, the company must create rules for both inbound and outbound traffic4",

The other five capabilities are: ? Platform architecture – Establish and maintain guidelines, principles, patterns, and guardrails for your cloud environment. ? Platform engineering – Build a compliant multi-account cloud environment with enhanced security features, and packaged, reusable cloud products. ? Platform operations – Manage and optimize your cloud environment with automation, monitoring, and incident response. ? Application development – Develop and deploy cloud-native applications using modern architectures and best practices. ? Application migration – Migrate your existing applications to the cloud using proven methodologies and tools. Performance and capacity management, infrastructure protection, and change and release management are not capabilities of the platform perspective. They are part of the operations perspective, which helps you achieve operational excellence in the cloud2. The operations perspective comprises six capabilities: ? Performance and capacity management – Monitor and optimize the performance and capacity of your cloud workloads. ? Infrastructure protection – Protect your cloud infrastructure from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and data breaches. ? Change and release management – Manage changes and releases to your cloud workloads using automation and governance. ? Configuration management – Manage the configuration of your cloud resources and applications using automation and version control. ? Incident management – Respond to incidents affecting your cloud workloads using best practices and tools. ? Service continuity management – Ensure the availability and resilience of your cloud workloads using backup, recovery, and disaster recovery strategies.",

      "explanation": "Agility in AWS Cloud computing means the ability to rapidly provision and deprovision AWS resources as needed, and the ability to experiment quickly with new ideas and solutions. Agility helps businesses to respond to changing customer demands, market opportunities, and competitive threats, and to innovate faster and cheaper. Agility also reduces the risk of failure, as businesses can test and validate their assumptions before committing to large-scale deployments. Some of the benefits of agility in AWS Cloud computing are: ? The speed at which AWS resources are implemented: AWS provides a variety of services and tools that allow you to create, configure, and launch AWS resources in minutes, using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Software Development Kits (AWS SDKs), or the AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to define your AWS resources as code using familiar programming languages, and synthesize them into AWS CloudFormation templates. You can also use the AWS Service Catalog to create and manage standardized portfolios of AWS resources that meet your organizational policies and best practices. AWS also offers on-demand, pay-as-you-go pricing models, so you only pay for the resources you use, and you can scale them up or down as your needs change12345 ? The ability to experiment quickly: AWS enables you to experiment quickly with new ideas and solutions, without having to invest in upfront capital or long-term commitments. You can use AWS to create and test multiple prototypes, hypotheses, and minimum viable products (MVPs) in parallel, and measure their performance and feedback. You can also use AWS to leverage existing services and solutions, such as AWS Marketplace, AWS Solutions, and AWS Quick Starts, that can help you accelerate your innovation process. AWS also supports a culture of experimentation and learning, by providing tools and resources for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), testing, monitoring, and analytics.

      "explanation": "The architecture deployment model that the company should use to meet this requirement is A. Multi-Region. A multi-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple geographic regions. A multi-region deployment model enables a company to achieve global reach, high availability, disaster recovery, and performance optimization. By deploying an application in multiple regions, a company can serve customers from the nearest region, reduce latency, increase redundancy, and comply with data sovereignty regulations12. A single-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single geographic region. A single-region deployment model is simpler and cheaper than a multi-region deployment model, but it has limited scalability, availability, and performance. A single-region deployment model may not be suitable for a company that wants to deploy an application globally, as it may face challenges such as network latency, regional outages, or regulatory compliance12. A multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple isolated locations within a single region. An Availability Zone is a physically separate location within an AWS Region that has independent power, cooling, and networking. A multi- AZ deployment model enhances the availability and durability of an application by providing redundancy and fault tolerance within a region34. A single-AZ deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single Availability Zone. A single-AZ deployment model is the simplest and most cost-effective option, but it has no redundancy or fault tolerance. A single-AZ deployment model may not be suitable for a company that wants to deploy an application globally, as it may face challenges such as network latency, regional outages, or regulatory compliance34.

It also involves associating the transformation initiatives with key stakeholders and measurable business outcomes1. ? Align phase: This phase focuses on identifying capability gaps across six perspectives: business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations. It also involves identifying cross-organizational dependencies and surfacing stakeholder concerns and challenges. The goal of this phase is to create strategies for improving the cloud readiness, ensure stakeholder alignment, and facilitate relevant organizational change management activities1. ? Launch phase: This phase focuses on delivering pilot initiatives in production and demonstrating incremental business value. Pilots should be highly impactful and influence future direction. The customer should learn from the pilots and adjust their approach before scaling to full production1. ? Scale phase: This phase focuses on expanding production pilots and business value to the desired scale and ensuring that the business benefits associated with the cloud investments are realized and sustained1.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Amazon EC2 instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content. It can also be used to store temporary data that you replicate across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. An instance store consists of one or more instance store volumes exposed as block devices. The size of an instance store as well as the number of devices available varies by instance type and instance size. The virtual devices for instance store volumes are ephemeral[0-23]. Instance types that support one instance store volume have ephemeral0. Instance types that support two or more instance store volumes have ephemeral0, ephemeral1, and so on. Instance store pricing Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance’s usage cost. The data on an instance store volume persists even if the instance is rebooted. However, the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. When the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, every block of the instance store volume is cryptographically erased. Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data. If you need to retain the data stored on an instance store volume beyond the lifetime of the instance, you need to manually copy that data to more persistent storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system. There are some events that can result in your data not persisting throughout the lifetime of the instance. The following table indicates whether data on instance store volumes is persisted during specific events, for both virtualized and bare metal instances1.

By moving to the AWS Cloud, the company can avoid the upfront costs of purchasing and maintaining on-premises infrastructure, such as servers, storage, network, and software. Instead, the company can pay only for the AWS resources and services that they use, as they use them. This reduces the risk and complexity of planning and managing IT infrastructure, and allows the company to focus on innovation and growth. Increased speed to market, massive economies of scale, and the ability to go global in minutes are also benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they are not the best ones to describe this scenario. Increased speed to market means that the company can launch new products and services faster by using AWS services and tools. Massive economies of scale means that the company can benefit from the lower costs and higher performance that AWS achieves by operating at a large scale. The ability to go global in minutes means that the company can deploy their applications and data in multiple regions and availability zones around the world to reach their customers faster and improve performance and reliability5",

AWS Snowmobile is a service that allows you to migrate large amounts of data to AWS using a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container that can store up to 100 petabytes of data. AWS Snowmobile is designed for situations where you need to move massive amounts of data to the cloud in a fast, secure, and cost-effective way. AWS Snowmobile has the least possible operational overhead because it eliminates the need to buy, configure, or manage hundreds or thousands of storage devices12. AWS Snowball Edge is a service that allows you to migrate data to AWS using a physical device that can store up to 80 terabytes of data and has compute and storage capabilities to run applications on the device. AWS Snowball Edge is suitable for situations where you have limited or intermittent network connectivity, or where bandwidth costs are high. However, AWS Snowball Edge has more operational overhead than AWS Snowmobile because you need to request multiple devices and transfer your data onto them using the client3.

The company can select the amount of compute usage per hour (e.g., $10/hour) that they want to commit to for the duration of the plan (1 year or 3 years).

Elasticity means the ability to adjust the resources and capacity of the system in response to changes in demand or environment. Scaling the number of Amazon EC2 instances based on traffic means using services such as AWS Auto Scaling or Elastic Load Balancing to add or remove instances as the traffic increases or decreases. Resizing Amazon RDS instances as business needs change means using the Amazon RDS console or API to modify the instance type, storage type, or storage size of the database as the workload grows or shrinks.

      "explanation": "Security groups are the AWS service or feature that can be used to apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances. Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more instances. Customers can create security groups and add rules that reflect the role of the instance that is associated with the security group. For example, a web server instance needs security group rules that allow inbound HTTP and HTTPS access, while a database instance needs rules that allow access for the type of database12. Security groups are stateful, meaning that the responses to allowed inbound traffic are also allowed, regardless of the outbound rules1. Customers can assign multiple security groups to an instance, and the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules1. Network ACLs are another AWS service or feature that can be used to control the traffic for a subnet. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that they allow. Therefore, customers must add rules for both inbound and outbound traffic3. Network ACLs are applied at the subnet level, not at the instance level. AWS Trusted Advisor is an AWS service that provides best practice recommendations for security, performance, cost optimization, and fault tolerance. AWS Trusted Advisor does not apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances, but it can help customers identify security gaps and improve their security posture4. AWS WAF is an AWS service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and bot attacks. AWS WAF does not apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances, but it can be integrated with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Application Load Balancer.",
