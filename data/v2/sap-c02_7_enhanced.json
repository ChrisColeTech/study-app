      "explanation": "Option C is correct because hosting the web application in Amazon S3, storing the uploaded videos in Amazon S3, and using S3 event notifications to publish events to the SQS queue reduces the operational overhead of managing EC2 instances and EBS volumes. Amazon S3 can serve static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from S3 buckets. Amazon S3 can also trigger AWS Lambda functions through S3 event notifications when new objects are created or existing objects are updated or deleted. AWS Lambda can process the SQS queue with an AWS Lambda function that calls the Amazon Rekognition API to categorize the videos.

      "explanation": "Option C is correct because hosting the web application in Amazon S3, storing the uploaded videos in Amazon S3, and using S3 event notifications to publish events to the SQS queue reduces the operational overhead of managing EC2 instances and EBS volumes. Amazon S3 can serve static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from S3 buckets. Amazon S3 can also trigger AWS Lambda functions through S3 event notifications when new objects are created or existing objects are updated or deleted.

By increasing the visibility timeout to 3 hours, this should give the EC2 instance enough time to process the message before it gets moved to the dead-letter queue.
