Using machine learning techniques would introduce unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. ? Option C (Correct): \"Use code that will calculate probability by using simple rules and computations\": This is the correct answer because it directly solves the problem with minimal overhead, using basic probability rules. ? Option A: \"Use supervised learning to create a regression model\" is incorrect as it overcomplicates the solution for a simple probability problem. ? Option B: \"Use reinforcement learning to train a model\" is incorrect because reinforcement learning is not needed for a simple probability calculation. ?
