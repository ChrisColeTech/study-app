Then, deploying the API's Lambda functions as Zip packages and configuring the packages to use the Lambda layer would meet the requirements for simplifying the deployment and optimizing for code reuse. A Lambda layer is a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. It allows you to manage your in-development function code separately from your dependencies, this way you can easily update your dependencies without having to update your entire function code. By deploying the shared libraries and custom classes to a Docker image and uploading the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), it makes it easy to manage and version the dependencies.

However, an SCP never grants permissions.\" SCPs alone are not sufficient to granting permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts. The administrator must still attach identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to actually grant permissions.
