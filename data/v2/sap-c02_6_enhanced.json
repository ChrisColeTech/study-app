To do this, the following steps are required: Upload static informational content to the S3 bucket. This will provide the source of the content that will be served to the visitors. Set the S3 bucket as a second origin in the original CloudFront distribution. Configure the distribution and the S3 bucket to use an origin access identity (OAI). This will allow CloudFront to access the S3 bucket securely and prevent public access to the bucket. During the weekly maintenance, edit the default cache behavior to use the S3 origin. Revert the change when the maintenance is complete. This will redirect all web requests to the S3 bucket instead of the Elastic Beanstalk domain name.

To do this, the following steps are required: Upload static informational content to the S3 bucket. This will provide the source of the content that will be served to the visitors.

This will allow CloudFront to access the S3 bucket securely and prevent public access to the bucket. During the weekly maintenance, edit the default cache behavior to use the S3 origin. Revert the change when the maintenance is complete. This will redirect all web requests to the S3 bucket instead of the Elastic Beanstalk domain name. The other options are not co...",
