Configure this tier to use Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the forms when forms are uploaded. Store the output in Amazon S3. Parse this output by extracting the data that is required within the application tier. Submit the data to the target system's API. This solution meets the requirements of accurate form extraction, minimal time to market, and minimal long-term operational overhead. Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend are fully managed and serverless services that can perform OCR and extract relevant data from the forms, which eliminates the need to develop custom libraries or train and host models.

By increasing the visibility timeout to 3 hours, this should give the EC2 instance enough time to process the message before it gets moved to the dead-letter queue.
