      "explanation": "Set up an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to perform continuous data replication from the on-premises database to Aurora. Create an Aurora Replica for the Aurora MySQL database, and move the aggregation jobs to run against the Aurora Replica. Set up collection endpoints as AWS Lambda functions behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and use Amazon RDS Proxy to write to the Aurora MySQL database. When the databases are synced, point the collector DNS record to the ALB. Disable the AWS DMS sync task after the cutover from on premises to AWS. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. With RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66%",

The company can store the email template on Amazon SES with parameters for the customer data and use an AWS Lambda function to call the SendTemplatedEmail API operation, passing in the customer data to replace the parameters and the email destination.

An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts. The administrator must still attach identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to actually grant permissions.
