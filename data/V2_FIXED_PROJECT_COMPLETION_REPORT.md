## Root Cause Analysis of Original Issues

### Primary Issue: Page-by-Page Processing
- **Problem**: Original V2 parser processed each PDF page independently
- **Impact**: Questions spanning multiple pages were truncated or missed
- **Solution**: Extract complete PDF text first, then parse questions globally

### Secondary Issues Fixed
1. **Format Detection Logic**: Equal scores caused wrong format selection
2. **Question Boundary Detection**: Improved regex patterns for question starts/ends
3. **Missing PDF**: The 8th PDF was completely overlooked
4. **Content Extraction**: Better handling of page breaks and text flow

## Generated Files and Locations

### Primary Study Datasets (Mobile-Ready)
**Location**: `/mnt/c/Projects/study-app/data/` and `/mnt/c/Projects/study-app/data/mobile-app/src/data/`

1. `aif-c01_3_study_data.json` - 31 questions (+2)
2. `aif-c01_6_study_data.json` - 28 questions (+2)
3. `clf-c02_2_study_data.json` - 93 questions (+7)
4. `clf-c02_6_study_data.json` - 94 questions (+10)
5. `sap-c02_6_study_data.json` - 59 questions (+8)

   - `study_data`: Array of question/answer pairs with rich metadata
   
3. **Usage Example**:
```javascript
// Load a dataset
import aiPractitioner from './data/aif-c01_3_study_data.json';
import cloudPractitioner from './data/clf-c02_2_study_data.json';
import proArchitect from './data/aws-sap-c02_pro8_study_data.json';

// Access questions
const questions = aiPractitioner.study_data;
console.log(`Loaded ${questions.length} questions`);
```
