        "explanation": "Deploying the shared libraries and custom classes to a Docker image and uploading the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and creating a Lambda layer that uses the Docker image as the source. Then, deploying the API's Lambda functions as Zip packages and configuring the packages to use the Lambda layer would meet the requirements for simplifying the deployment and optimizing for code reuse. A Lambda layer is a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. It allows you to manage your in-development function code separately from your dependencies, this way you can easily update your dependencies without having to update your entire function code. By deploying the shared libraries and custom classes to a Docker image and uploading the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), it makes it easy to manage and version the dependencies. This way, the company can use the same version of the dependencies across different Lambda functions. By creating a Lambda layer that uses the Docker image as the source, the company can configure the API's Lambda functions to use the layer, reducing the need to include the dependencies in each function package, and making it easy to update the dependencies across all functions at once.

        "correct_answer": "CE",
        "explanation": "Option C is correct because leveraging Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda to ingest and process the raw data resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that simplifies the capture, processing, and storage of data streams at any scale. Kinesis Data Streams can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low latency. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda can be triggered by Kinesis Data Streams events and process the data records in real time. Lambda can also scale automatically based on the incoming data volume. By using Kinesis Data Streams and Lambda, the company can reduce the load on the API servers and improve the performance and scalability of the data ingestion and processing layer3 Option E is correct because re-architecting the database tier to use Amazon DynamoDB instead of an RDS MySQL DB instance resolves the issues permanently and enable growth as new sensors are provisioned. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value and document database that delivers single- digit millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB supports auto scaling, which automatically adjusts read and write capacity based on actual traffic patterns. DynamoDB also supports on-demand capacity mode, which instantly accommodates up to double the previous peak traffic on a table. By using DynamoDB instead of RDS MySQL DB instance, the company can eliminate high write latency and improve scalability and performance of the database tier.

        "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because creating a Direct Connect gateway in the central account and creating an association proposal by using the Direct Connect gateway and the account ID for every virtual private gateway does not enable active-passive failover between the regions. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource that enables you to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface (VIF) to one or more VPCs in any AWS Region. A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of a VPN connection. You can associate a Direct Connect gateway with either a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. However, a Direct Connect gateway does not provide any load balancing or failover capabilities by itself1 Option B is correct because creating a Direct Connect gateway and a transit gateway in the central network account and attaching the transit gateway to the Direct Connect gateway by using a transit VIF meets the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. A transit VIF is a type of private VIF that you can use to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection to a transit gateway or a Direct Connect gateway. A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks. By using a transit VIF, you can route traffic between your on-premises network and multiple VPCs across different AWS accounts and Regions through a single connection23 Option C is incorrect because provisioning an internet gateway, attaching the internet gateway to subnets, and allowing internet traffic through the gateway does not meet the requirement of routing cloud resources to the internet through its on-premises data center. An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. By using an internet gateway, you are routing cloud resources directly to the internet, not through your on-premises data center. Option D is correct because sharing the transit gateway with other accounts and attaching VPCs to the transit gateway meets the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. You can share your transit gateway with other AWS accounts within the same organization by using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This allows you to centrally manage connectivity from multiple accounts without having to create individual peering connections between VPCs or duplicate network appliances in each account. You can attach VPCs from different accounts and Regions to your shared transit gateway and enable routing between them. Option E is incorrect because provisioning VPC peering as necessary does not meet the requirement of enabling the corporate network to access the resources on AWS seamlessly and also to communicate with all the VPCs. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account within a single Region. However, VPC peering does not allow you to route traffic from your on-premises network to your VPCs or between multiple Regions. You would need to create multiple VPN connections or Direct Connect connections for each VPC peering connection, which increases operational complexity and costs. Option F is correct because provisioning only private subnets, opening the necessary route on the transit gateway and customer gateway to allow outbound internet traffic from AWS to flow through NAT services that run in the data center meets the requirement of routing cloud resources to the internet through its on- premises data center. A private subnet is a subnet that’s associated with a route table that has no route to an internet gateway.

        "correct_answer": "BC",
        "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because creating an SCP to set a fixed monthly account usage limit is not possible. SCPs are policies that specify the services and actions that users and roles can use in the member accounts of an AWS Organization. SCPs cannot enforce budget limits or prevent users from launching costly services or running services unnecessarily1 Option B is correct because using AWS Budgets to create a fixed monthly budget for each developer’s account as part of the account creation process meets the requirement of giving developers a fixed monthly budget to limit their AWS costs. AWS Budgets allows you to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. You can create budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount2 Option C is correct because creating an SCP to deny access to costly services and components meets the requirement of ensuring that developers are not launching costly services or running services unnecessarily. SCPs can restrict access to certain AWS services or actions based on conditions such as region, resource tags, or request time. For example, an SCP can deny access to Amazon Redshift clusters or Amazon EC2 instances with certain instance types1 Option D is incorrect because creating an IAM policy to deny access to costly services and components is not sufficient to meet the requirement of ensuring that developers are not launching costly services or running services unnecessarily. IAM policies can only control access to resources within a single AWS account. If developers have multiple accounts or can create new accounts, they can bypass the IAM policy restrictions. SCPs can apply across multiple accounts within an AWS Organization and prevent users from creating new accounts that do not comply with the SCP rules3 Option E is incorrect because creating an AWS Budgets alert action to terminate services when the budgeted amount is reached is not possible. AWS Budgets alert actions can only perform one of the following actions: apply an IAM policy, apply an SCP, or send a notification through Amazon SNS. AWS Budgets alert actions cannot terminate services directly. Option F is correct because creating an AWS Budgets alert action to send an Amazon SNS notification when the budgeted amount is reached and invoking an AWS Lambda function to terminate all services meets the requirement of giving developers a fixed monthly budget to limit their AWS costs. AWS Budgets alert actions can send notifications through Amazon SNS when a budget threshold is breached.

This is the most efficient solution as it will not require additional steps such as analyzing CloudTrail events or manually creating and testing an IAM policy. You can use the IAM policy simulator to generate an IAM policy for an IAM role by specifying the role and the API actions and resources that the application or service requires. The simulator will then generate an IAM policy that grants the least privilege access to those actions and resources. Once you have generated an IAM policy using the simulator, you can replace the existing SecretsManagerReadWnte policy that is attached to the IAM role with the newly generated policy. This will ensure that the application or service has the least privilege access to the Secrets Manager actions that it requires. You can access the IAM policy simulator through the IAM console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.

A replication group consists of a primary node and up to five read-only replica nodes that are synchronized with the primary node using asynchronous replication.

However, an SCP never grants permissions.\" SCPs alone are not sufficient to granting permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts. The administrator must still attach identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to actually grant permissions. The effective permissions are the logical intersection between what is allowed by the SCP and what is allowed by the IAM and resource-based policies.",

By creating a management account and inviting all the existing accounts to join the organization, the solutions architect can track and consolidate expenditures for all the accounts using AWS Cost Management tools such as AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets. An organizational unit (OU) is a group of accounts within an organization that can be used to apply policies and simplify management. A service control policy (SCP) is a type of policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. By creating an OU that includes all the development teams and applying an SCP that allows the creation of resources only in Regions that are in the United States, the solutions architect can ensure that the company meets its compliance requirements and avoids unwanted charges from other Regions. An IAM role is an identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. By creating an IAM role in the management account and allowing the finance team users to assume it, the solutions architect can give them access to view the Billing and Cost Management console without sharing credentials or creating additional users.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables users to send messages to multiple subscribers1. Users can send event details to an Amazon SNS topic and configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber to the SNS topic to process the events. Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources2. Users can add an on-failure destination to the function and set an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the target. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables users to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications3. This way, if a processing error occurs, the event will move into the separate queue for review. Option B is incorrect because publishing events to an Amazon SQS queue and creating an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group will not have the ability to scale in and out based on the number of events that the solution receives. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Auto Scaling is a feature that helps users maintain application availability and allows them to scale their EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions they define. However, for this use case, using SQS and EC2 will not take advantage of the serverless capabilities of Lambda and SNS. Option C is incorrect because writing events to an Amazon DynamoDB table and configuring a DynamoDB stream for the table will not have the ability to move events into a separate queue for review if a processing error occurs. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB Streams is a feature that captures data modification events in DynamoDB tables. Users can configure the stream to invoke a Lambda function, but they cannot configure an on-failure destination for the function. Option D is incorrect because publishing events to an Amazon EventBridge event bus and setting an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the event bus target will not have the ability to move events into a separate queue for review if a processing error occurs. Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications with data from a variety of sources. An ALB is a load balancer that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. Users can configure EventBridge to retry events, but they cannot configure an on-failure destination for the ALB.",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The company should configure a cross-Region read replica for the RDS database in the new Region. The company should change the Route 53 record to latency- based routing to connect to the API Gateway API. This solution will meet the requirements because a cross-Region read replica is a feature that enables you to create a MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server read replica in a different Region from the source DB instance. You can use cross-Region read replicas to improve availability and disaster recovery, scale out globally, or migrate an existing database to a new Region1. By creating a cross-Region read replica for the RDS database in the new Region, the company can have a standby copy of its primary database that can serve read-only traffic from users in Europe. A latency-based routing policy is a feature that enables you to route traffic based on the latency between your users and your resources. You can use latency-based routing to route traffic to the resource that provides the best latency2. By changing the Route 53 record to latency-based routing, the company can minimize latency for users who download reports by connecting them to the API Gateway API in the Region that provides the best response time. The other options are not correct because: Using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the primary database in the original Region to the database in the new Region would not be as cost-effective or simple as using a cross-Region read replica. AWS DMS is a service that enables you to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. You can use AWS DMS to perform one-time migrations or continuous data replication with high availability and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse3. However, AWS DMS requires more configuration and management than creating a cross-Region read replica, which is fully managed by Amazon RDS. AWS DMS also incurs additional charges for replication instances and tasks. Creating an Amazon API Gateway Data API service integration with Amazon Redshift would not help with disaster recovery or minimizing latency. The Data API is a feature that enables you to query your Amazon Redshift cluster using HTTP requests, without needing a persistent connection or a SQL client. It is useful for building applications that interact with Amazon Redshift, but not for replicating or recovering data from an RDS database. Creating an AWS Data Exchange datashare by connecting AWS Data Exchange to the Redshift cluster would not help with disaster recovery or minimizing latency. AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange data in the cloud. You can use AWS Data Exchange to subscribe to a diverse selection of third-party data products or offer your own data products to other AWS customers.

A public VIF allows you to access AWS public services such as EC21. A Site-to-Site VPN connection over the public VIF provides encryption and redundancy for the traffic between the on-premises data center and the VPCs2. This solution is cheaper than setting up additional Direct Connect connections or using a private VIF with VPC peering.",
