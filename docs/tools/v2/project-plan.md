# V2 Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create V2 tools to process multiple AWS certification PDF formats using proven V1 architecture

**Scope**: Convert 7 PDFs (CLF-C02, SAP-C02, AIF-C01) into individual study datasets compatible with existing mobile application

**Timeline**: 4 weeks development + testing

## Project Components

### 1. Format Detection System
**Technology**: Python regex pattern matching
**Purpose**: Automatically identify PDF format type (SurePassExam, Numbered, Standard)
**Input**: Raw PDF content
**Output**: Format classification for parser routing

### 2. Multi-Format Parsing Tools (5 Tools)
**Technology**: Python + pdfplumber (same as V1)
**Purpose**: Extract questions and answers from different PDF formats
**Architecture**: Same 5-tool pipeline as V1 with updated patterns

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
**Technology**: JSON intermediate files (same as V1)
**Purpose**: Multi-source answer combination and quality validation
**Output**: Individual study datasets per PDF

### 4. Mobile Application Integration  
**Technology**: React Native (same as V1)
**Purpose**: Load V2 datasets with existing mobile application
**Enhancement**: Optional multi-exam selection capability

## Technology Decisions

### Core Processing Stack
- **PDF Parsing**: pdfplumber (proven in V1)
- **Pattern Matching**: Python regex (same patterns approach as V1)
- **Data Format**: JSON with comprehensive metadata (identical to V1)
- **Quality Assurance**: Confidence scoring and validation (same as V1)

### Format Detection Strategy
```python
# Multi-format detection approach
def detect_pdf_format(content: str) -> str:
    formats = {
        'surepassexam': r'NEW QUESTION\s+\d+.*Topic\s+\d+',
        'numbered': r'^\d+\.\s+(?:Which|What|How)',
        'standard': r'Question\s+\d+:'
    }
    # Return detected format or 'unknown'
```

### Data Integration Approach
- **Individual Processing**: Each PDF becomes separate study dataset
- **Format Consistency**: All outputs use V1-compatible JSON structure
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Direct integration with existing React Native app

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Parser Development (Week 1)
**Deliverables**:
- V2 PDF Parser with format detection
- V2 Answer Parser for integrated content
- Basic testing on CLF-C02 format

**Success Criteria**:
- >90% question extraction from CLF-C02 PDFs
- Format detection accuracy >95%
- Basic answer extraction working

### Phase 2: Enhanced Processing (Week 2)  
**Deliverables**:
- V2 Enhanced Answer Parser (edge case handling)
- V2 Aggressive Parser (fallback strategies)
- Testing on SAP-C02 and AIF-C01 formats

**Success Criteria**:
- Multi-format processing working
- Answer extraction >85% across all formats
- Quality validation and confidence scoring implemented

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Week 3)
**Deliverables**:
- V2 Data Combiner (same logic as V1)
- End-to-end pipeline testing
- Mobile app compatibility validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete pipeline processing all 7 PDFs
- JSON outputs compatible with existing mobile app
- Quality assurance processes implemented

### Phase 4: Production and Deployment (Week 4)
**Deliverables**:
- Batch processing of all exam-material PDFs
- Quality review and manual validation
- Documentation and deployment guides

**Success Criteria**:
- 7 complete study datasets generated
- Quality validation completed with manual review
- Mobile app successfully loading V2 datasets

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Results
- **Total Questions**: ~700 questions across 7 study datasets
- **Certification Coverage**: CLF-C02, SAP-C02, AIF-C01 certification types
- **Processing Success**: >90% question extraction, >85% answer extraction
- **Mobile Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing app

### Deliverable Files

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Format Detection Failures**: Mitigation - Conservative detection with manual override
2. **Answer Extraction Accuracy**: Mitigation - Multi-source parsing like V1
3. **Content Quality Variations**: Mitigation - Confidence scoring for manual review

### Project Risks  
1. **Timeline Delays**: Mitigation - Progressive testing per format type
2. **Quality Issues**: Mitigation - Same validation processes as successful V1
3. **Mobile Integration**: Mitigation - V1-compatible JSON structure ensures compatibility

## Success Metrics

### Processing Quality
- PDF Format Detection: >95% accuracy
- Question Extraction: >90% per PDF  
- Answer Extraction: >85% per PDF
- Mobile Compatibility: 100% (same format as V1)

### Project Success
- All 7 target PDFs processed successfully
- Study datasets compatible with existing mobile application
- Quality validation completed with manual review processes
- Documentation complete for future maintenance and updates

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- Python development environment (same as V1)
- Access to exam-material PDFs
- Testing environment for mobile app integration
- Manual review capacity for quality validation

### Infrastructure  
- Same development setup as V1 project
- JSON file storage for intermediate and final datasets
- Mobile app testing capability (React Native environment)
