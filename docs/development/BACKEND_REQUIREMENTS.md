# Generic Project Requirements

This document serves as a comprehensive requirements template for greenfield application development projects.

## üéØ Project Objective

Create a well-architected application using modern development practices. This is a greenfield project that should prioritize code quality, maintainability, and comprehensive documentation.

## üìö Documentation Requirements

### **Documentation Folder**: `backend/docs/`

**CRITICAL**: All documentation must be created **BEFORE** any implementation work begins.

### **Required Documents** (6 documents total):

#### **1. COMPREHENSIVE README Document**

- **Purpose**: Document ALL features and requirements for the application
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Complete feature specification
  - All functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
  - Technology stack justification
  - Integration requirements
  - Configuration options and environment variables
  - Complete compatibility and constraint analysis

#### **2. FULL Implementation Plan Document**

- **CRITICAL SPECIFICATION**: **ONE FEATURE PER PHASE**
- **What this means**:
  - Each individual feature gets its own dedicated phase
  - NOT grouping multiple features together
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Each phase focuses on ONE specific feature
  - Reference any existing systems or specifications for that feature
  - Explain how to implement that ONE feature
  - Keep implementation details separate from planning
  - NO code examples in the plan itself (they go in separate document)
  - Link to the separate code examples document

#### **3. Project Structure Document**

- **Purpose**: Serve as the centralized reference for all file organization
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Complete file and folder structure for the application
  - Clear component organization and relationships
  - Module dependencies and imports structure
  - Reference point for all other documentation

#### **4. Architecture Document**

- **SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**:
  - **SOLID principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
  - **DRY principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself guidelines
  - **Anti-pattern prevention**: Directives for no spaghetti code or massive monster classes
  - **Best practices**: Guidelines to follow for clean code
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Concrete examples of SOLID principles in chosen technology
  - Specific rules for preventing anti-patterns
  - Enforceable guidelines (size limits, complexity rules)
  - Code quality standards
  - Design patterns to be used
  - Technology-specific best practices

#### **5. API Reference Document**

- **Purpose**: Complete documentation of all API endpoints/interfaces
- **Content Requirements**:
  - All endpoints/public interfaces
  - Request/response formats
  - Error handling
  - Authentication/authorization requirements
  - Usage examples
  - Rate limiting and constraints

#### **6. Code Examples Document**

- **Purpose**: Provide detailed code examples for implementation patterns
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Technology-specific implementation examples
  - Common design patterns for the chosen stack
  - Implementation examples that support the implementation plan
  - Detailed code snippets showing exact approaches
- **Critical**: This document must be referenced from the implementation plan but kept separate

## üîÑ Implementation Approach Requirements

### **Development Philosophy**

- **Feature-Driven Development**: Build one complete feature at a time
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Documentation-First**: All features must be documented before coding
- **Quality-First**: Code quality standards are non-negotiable

### **Code Examples Separation**

**Requirements**:

1. Implementation plan should focus on planning and analysis
2. Code examples belong in a separate dedicated document
3. Link to the separate code examples document from the implementation plan
4. No extensive code blocks in planning documents

### **Architecture Focus**

**Requirements**:

1. Must include SOLID principles
2. Must include DRY principle guidelines
3. Must include specific anti-pattern prevention
4. Must include directives against spaghetti code
5. Must include directives against monster classes
6. Must provide enforceable best practices

## üìã Quality Standards

### **Documentation Quality Requirements**

1. **Accuracy**: All documentation must be based on thorough analysis and research
2. **Completeness**: Cover ALL features and requirements, not just major ones
3. **Specificity**: Reference specific technologies, frameworks, and implementation details
