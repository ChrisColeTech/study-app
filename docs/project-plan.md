# Study App Project Plan

## Overview
Create an exam-style study application that converts PDF study guides and text answer files into an interactive multiple choice/multiple response quiz system.

## Components

### 1. PDF Parser Tool
- Extract questions from PDF study guide
- Group questions by sections
- Handle standard question format
- Output structured question data

### 2. Answer Parser Tool  
- Parse non-standard text file format
- Organize answers to match questions
- Handle format inconsistencies
- Output structured answer data

### 3. Question-Answer Matcher
- Combine parsed questions with answers
- Validate question-answer pairs
- Create unified data structure

### 4. Study App Interface
- Display questions by section
- Support multiple choice questions
- Support multiple response questions
- Randomize questions within sections
- Track user progress/scores

## Technology Stack
- Python for parsing tools (pdfplumber for reliable PDF parsing)
- React Native for cross-platform mobile study app
- JSON for data storage/exchange
- AsyncStorage for offline question storage and user progress
- JavaScript/TypeScript for mobile app development

## Development Phases
1. âœ… Analysis and tool development
2. Parsing tool implementation
3. Data processing and validation
4. Mobile study application development
5. Testing and app store deployment

## Key Findings from Analysis

### PDF Structure (AWS SAA-C03)
- **Format**: "Topic X Question #Y" - highly consistent
- **Questions**: 500+ questions across 249 pages
- **Types**: Single choice, "Choose two/three", "Select all"
- **Options**: A-D (mostly), some A-E
- **Extraction success**: ~98% (4 problematic pages)

### Answer File Structure (AWS SAA-03 Solution.txt)
- **Format**: Mixed - "ans-", "A.", "B", etc.
- **Size**: 588KB with detailed explanations
- **Numbering**: Sequential 1], 2], 3]...
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent formatting, needs multiple parsers
