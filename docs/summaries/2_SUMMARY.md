## 2. Business Entities and Relationships

### 2.1 Entity Architecture
**Critical Insight**: **NO ARTIFICIAL HIERARCHIES** - Providers don't "contain" exams, exams don't "contain" topics. All entities are independent with reference relationships.

### 2.2 Key Relationships Identified
**Many-to-Many Relationships**:
- **Topics ↔ Exams**: Topics span multiple exams, exams contain multiple topics
- **Questions ↔ Topics**: Questions cover multiple topics, topics contain multiple questions

**One-to-Many Relationships**:
- **User → StudySessions**: Users have multiple study sessions
- **User → UserProgress**: Users have progress records per provider/exam/topic
- **User → Goals**: Users can set multiple study goals

**Reference Relationships** (No foreign keys):
- **StudySession references Questions**: Via questionIds in answers array
- **UserProgress references Provider/Exam/Topic**: Via string identifiers
- **Analytics references all entities**: For computation purposes

### 2.3 Storage Patterns
- **Database Storage**: User, StudySession, UserProgress, Goal (DynamoDB with GSI indexes)
- **File Storage**: Provider, Exam, Topic, Question (S3 JSON files)
- **Cache Storage**: Analytics (Redis, temporary)
- **Embedded Storage**: Answer (within StudySession JSON)

## 5. Architecture and Implementation Implications

### 5.1 Storage Architecture Decisions
**Hybrid Storage Approach**:
- **Static Content** (Questions, Providers, Exams, Topics): S3 JSON files
- **User Data** (Users, Sessions, Progress, Goals): DynamoDB database
- **Computed Data** (Analytics): Redis cache with on-demand generation

**Rationale**: Separates content management from user data, enables efficient caching and content updates without database migrations.

### 5.2 API Architecture Patterns
**RESTful Design with Extensions**:
- Standard CRUD operations for user-controlled entities
- Read-only access to content entities
- Special endpoints for complex operations (search, analytics, adaptive sessions)

**Authentication Strategy**:
- JWT TOKEN authorizer at API Gateway level
- Proven working approach with Base64URL support
- Configurable token expiration

### 5.3 Performance Architecture
**Multi-Layer Caching Strategy**:
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory (5 minutes) for frequently accessed data
- **L2 Cache**: Redis (30 minutes - 2 hours) for computed results
- **Cold Start Optimization**: Individual Lambda bundling + ARM64 architecture

### 5.4 Scalability Considerations
**Auto-Scaling Components**:
- Lambda functions scale automatically with demand
- Database connection pooling for concurrent access
- CDN distribution for global performance
- Redis clustering for cache scaling

### 5.5 Implementation Priorities
**Phase 1 Implementation**:
1. Core authentication and user management
2. Basic study session functionality
3. Question loading and answer submission
4. Basic progress tracking
