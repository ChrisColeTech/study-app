## Executive Summary

Phase 3 conducted a comprehensive architecture analysis focused on applying clean architecture principles to rebuild the compromised V2 backend infrastructure. The analysis established clear separation of concerns, defined handler responsibilities, and planned service layer and repository patterns for the 29 API endpoints identified in Phase 2.

## 1. Architecture Analysis Performed in Phase 3

### 1.1 Current Implementation Review

**Infrastructure Status Assessment**:
- **Critical Finding**: V2 infrastructure requires complete rebuild from source code following clean architecture principles
- **Root Cause**: Accumulated hacks instead of proper fixes led to compromised infrastructure
- **Scope**: Only 3 of 31 API endpoints currently tested/working
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js 20 + TypeScript, Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 architecture confirmed

**Current State Analysis**:
- **Working Components**: Auth system (registration, login, JWT), TOKEN authorizer, providers endpoint
- **Broken Components**: 28 endpoints not properly implemented, question management, study sessions, analytics
- **Infrastructure Gap**: Missing Lambda environment variables, incomplete service layer separation

**Database Schema and Data Flow Understanding**:
- **Dual Storage Architecture**: DynamoDB for user data, S3 for question data (JSON files)
- **DynamoDB Schema**: Users, StudySessions, UserProgress, Goals tables with GSIs (email-index, UserIdIndex)
- **S3 Structure**: Organized by provider/exam hierarchy (`s3://bucket/questions/aws/saa-c03/questions.json`)
- **Data Flow**: Authentication via DynamoDB → Session creation → Question loading from S3 → Progress tracking

### 1.2 CDK and Lambda Structure Review

**CDK Infrastructure Analysis**:
- **Deployment Status**: V2 stack deployed in us-east-2 region with CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda architecture
- **Architecture Pattern**: Individual Lambda functions per endpoint (ARM64, separate bundling) - confirmed as correct approach
- **Configuration Gap**: Missing `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN: '2h'` environment variable for Lambdas

**Lambda Organization**:
- **Function Distribution**: 29 individual Lambda functions (one per endpoint)
- **Naming Convention**: `StudyAppV2-{HandlerName}-dev` with domain-based organization
- **Performance Strategy**: Separate bundling for optimal cold start performance

## 2. Clean Architecture Principles Analyzed and Defined

### 2.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Application

**Handler-Level SRP Implementation**:
Each of the 29 handlers defined with exactly one responsibility:
- **Authentication Domain**: RegisterHandler (only user registration), LoginHandler (only authentication), RefreshHandler (only token refresh), LogoutHandler (only logout)
- **Question Domain**: ListQuestionsHandler (only question retrieval), SearchQuestionsHandler (only full-text search)
- **Session Domain**: CreateSessionHandler (only session creation), SubmitAnswersHandler (only answer submission)
- **Analytics Domain**: GetProgressAnalyticsHandler (only progress analytics), GetPerformanceAnalyticsHandler (only performance insights)

**SRP Benefits Identified**:
- Each handler has exactly one reason to change
- Domain changes affect only relevant handlers
- Clear testing boundaries and responsibilities

### 2.2 Separation of Concerns

**Four-Layer Architecture Defined**:

1. **Handler Layer (API Controllers)**:
   - ONLY handle HTTP requests/responses
   - ONLY perform input validation and sanitization
   - ONLY call appropriate service methods
   - NO business logic - delegate to service layer

2. **Service Layer (Business Logic)**:
   - ONLY contain domain-specific business rules
   - ONLY orchestrate repository and external service calls
   - ONLY handle business validation and processing
   - NO HTTP concerns - pure business logic

3. **Repository Layer (Data Access)**:
   - ONLY handle data persistence operations
   - ONLY abstract database/file system specifics
   - NO business logic - pure data operations

4. **External Service Layer (Infrastructure)**:
   - ONLY handle external API calls and file operations
   - ONLY manage S3 operations, Redis caching
   - NO business logic - pure infrastructure

**Domain Separation Strategy**:
- **Authentication Domain**: JWT generation, password hashing, user validation
- **Question Domain**: Question filtering, search logic, caching strategies
- **Session Domain**: Session lifecycle management, progress calculation
- **Analytics Domain**: Performance calculations, trend analysis

### 2.3 Dependency Injection Architecture

**Service Dependencies Mapped**:
- **Authentication Handlers**: Require IUserService, IAuthService, IEmailService
- **Question Handlers**: Require IQuestionService, ICacheService, IFileService
- **Session Handlers**: Require ISessionService, IQuestionService, IAnalyticsService
- **Analytics Handlers**: Require IAnalyticsService, IProgressService, ICacheService

**Repository Dependencies Planned**:
- **Authentication Services**: Require IUserRepository, ITokenRepository
- **Question Services**: Require IQuestionRepository, ICacheRepository
- **Session Services**: Require ISessionRepository, IProgressRepository

**External Service Dependencies**:
- **Infrastructure Services**: IDynamoDBClient, IS3Client, IRedisClient, ISecretsManager
- **Utility Services**: ILogger, IValidator, ICrypto

## 3. Handler Responsibility Mapping

### 3.1 Complete API Endpoint to Handler Mapping

**29 Endpoints Mapped to Individual Handlers**:
- **Authentication Domain (4)**: `/auth/register` → RegisterHandler, `/auth/login` → LoginHandler, `/auth/refresh` → RefreshTokenHandler, `/auth/logout` → LogoutHandler
- **Provider Domain (2)**: `/providers` → ListProvidersHandler, `/providers/{id}` → GetProviderDetailsHandler
- **Exam Domain (2)**: `/exams` → ListExamsHandler, `/exams/{id}` → GetExamDetailsHandler  
- **Topic Domain (2)**: `/topics` → ListTopicsHandler, `/topics/{id}` → GetTopicDetailsHandler
- **Question Domain (3)**: `/questions` → ListQuestionsHandler, `/questions/{id}` → GetQuestionDetailsHandler, `/questions/search` → SearchQuestionsHandler
- **Session Domain (7)**: `/sessions` → CreateSessionHandler, `/sessions/{id}` → GetSessionHandler, plus update, delete, submit answers, complete, and adaptive session handlers
- **Analytics Domain (3)**: Progress, session, and performance analytics handlers
- **Goals Domain (4)**: List, create, update, delete goal handlers
- **Health Domain (2)**: Basic and detailed health check handlers

### 3.2 Cross-Handler Contamination Prevention

**Domain Isolation Rules Established**:
- Authentication handlers cannot directly call Session/Question/Analytics handlers
- Question handlers cannot directly call Authentication/Session handlers
- Session handlers cannot directly call other domain handlers directly
- Analytics handlers cannot directly call other domain handlers

**Communication Flow Defined**:
- Handlers only communicate through injected services
- Services can call other services within their domain or shared services
- Cross-domain communication only through properly injected service dependencies

### 3.3 Handler Responsibility Boundaries

**What Each Handler Does vs Doesn't Do**:

**Universal Handler Responsibilities** (All handlers MUST):
- HTTP request parsing and validation
- HTTP response formatting according to API contract  
- Error handling and proper status codes
- Request logging and input sanitization

**Universal Handler Prohibitions** (All handlers MUST NOT):
- Business logic implementation
- Direct database/file system access
- Cross-domain handler communication
- Infrastructure concerns (caching, external APIs)

**Domain-Specific Examples**:
- **RegisterHandler**: ONLY validate registration request, call UserService.register(), format response. NEVER do email sending, password hashing, database access
- **CreateSessionHandler**: ONLY validate session config, call SessionService.createSession(), return session details. NEVER do question loading, randomization, session persistence
- **ListQuestionsHandler**: ONLY parse query filters, call QuestionService.getQuestions(), format response. NEVER do S3 file reading, filtering logic, caching decisions

## 4. Service Layer and Repository Patterns Established

### 4.1 Domain-Specific Service Design

**Six Core Domain Services Defined**:

1. **UserService** (Authentication Domain): Registration, profile management, account operations
2. **AuthService** (Authentication Domain): JWT operations, password validation, token management
3. **QuestionService** (Question Domain): Question filtering, search, caching, cross-provider logic
4. **SessionService** (Session Domain): Session lifecycle, question randomization, progress calculation
5. **AnalyticsService** (Analytics Domain): Trend analysis, competency scoring, performance calculations
6. **GoalsService** (Goals Domain): Goal validation, progress tracking, milestone management

**Three Shared Services Defined**:
1. **CacheService**: Cache key generation, TTL management, invalidation strategies
2. **EmailService**: Template selection, delivery scheduling, retry logic
3. **ValidationService**: Cross-field validation, business rule validation

### 4.2 Repository Pattern Implementation

**Repository Interface Design by Storage Type**:

**DynamoDB Repositories (User Data)**:
- **IUserRepository**: User CRUD operations with email-index GSI queries
- **ISessionRepository**: Session management with answer tracking
- **IProgressRepository**: Progress tracking with bulk update operations
- **IGoalsRepository**: Goal management operations

**S3 Repositories (Question Data)**:
- **IQuestionRepository**: File-based question loading with provider/exam organization
- **IProviderRepository**: Provider and exam metadata access

**Caching Repository (Redis)**:
- **ICacheRepository**: Hierarchical key naming, TTL management, pipeline operations

### 4.3 Repository Implementation Strategy

**DynamoDB Implementation**:
- AWS SDK v3 DynamoDBClient usage
- GSI queries for email-index, UserIdIndex
- Batch operations and transactions for efficiency
- Pagination for large result sets

**S3 Implementation**:
- Lazy loading of question data
- Path-based file organization (provider/exam structure)
- JSON streaming for large files
- Concurrent file loading for cross-provider sessions

**Redis Implementation**:
- Connection pooling for Lambda reuse
- Hierarchical key naming (`user:123:progress`)
- TTL management for different data types
- Graceful degradation if cache unavailable

### 4.4 Service Layer Business Logic Examples

**Complex Business Logic Patterns Defined**:

**SessionService.createSession()**:
1. Validate configuration (provider/exam combinations)
2. Load questions from multiple S3 sources
3. Apply session logic (cross-provider mixing, randomization, difficulty selection)
4. Create session entity with metadata
5. Initialize progress tracking
6. Cache questions for fast access

**AnalyticsService.getProgressAnalytics()**:
1. Gather data from multiple repositories
2. Compute metrics (accuracy trends, topic performance, skill transferability)
3. Apply business rules (mastery levels, weak areas, goal progress)
4. Format analytics for client consumption
5. Cache results for performance
