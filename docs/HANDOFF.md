# Study App V2 - Handoff Document

## üö® CRITICAL: Incomplete Work Status

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Major authentication breakthrough achieved, but comprehensive testing was NOT completed as requested.

## ‚úÖ **ACTUALLY COMPLETED**

### Infrastructure & Core Systems
- ‚úÖ **V2 Stack Deployed**: All infrastructure operational in us-east-2
- ‚úÖ **DynamoDB GSI Fix**: Added critical email-index and UserIdIndex GSIs 
- ‚úÖ **Auth System Working**: Registration and login endpoints fully functional
- ‚úÖ **TOKEN Authorizer**: JWT validation working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Providers Endpoint**: Protected route confirmed working
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment workflow operational

### Current API Status
- **API Gateway**: https://e5j3043jy0.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/
- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Working (shows "unhealthy" but endpoint functional)
- **Auth Register**: ‚úÖ Working (creates users with JWT tokens)
- **Auth Login**: ‚úÖ Working (returns valid JWT tokens)
- **Providers**: ‚úÖ Working (requires auth, returns provider data)

## ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE / NOT TESTED**

### API Endpoints - NEVER FULLY TESTED
- ‚ùì **Questions Endpoint**: Got "Unauthorized" - token expiration suspected but NOT debugged
- ‚ùì **Sessions Endpoint**: Got "Unauthorized" - NOT debugged  
- ‚ùì **Goals Endpoint**: NEVER TESTED
- ‚ùì **Analytics Endpoint**: NEVER TESTED
- ‚ùì **All sub-endpoints**: sessions/{id}, goals/{id}/milestones, etc. - NEVER TESTED

### Data Layer Validation - NOT DONE
- ‚ùì **S3 Question Data**: Never verified if question files are accessible
- ‚ùì **Question Filtering**: Never tested provider/exam filtering
- ‚ùì **Session Data Storage**: Never tested if sessions save to DynamoDB correctly
- ‚ùì **User Data Integrity**: Never validated user profile updates work

### End-to-End Workflows - NOT TESTED
- ‚ùì **Registration ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Session Creation ‚Üí Question Answering**: NEVER TESTED
- ‚ùì **Session State Management**: Never verified session progress tracking works
- ‚ùì **Analytics Collection**: Never verified user progress data is collected
- ‚ùì **Goal Management**: Never tested goal creation/tracking functionality

## üîß **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### Token Expiration Issue (Blocking Testing)
**Problem**: JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes, causing "Unauthorized" during testing  
**Impact**: Cannot complete comprehensive endpoint testing  
**Required Fix**: Either extend token expiration or implement proper token refresh for testing

### Data Population Verification
**Problem**: Unknown if S3 contains actual question data or if it's accessible  
**Impact**: Questions endpoint may fail due to missing data, not auth issues  
**Required Action**: Verify S3 bucket contains question files and Lambda can access them

### Systematic Endpoint Testing
**Problem**: No comprehensive test suite was run despite user request  
**Impact**: Unknown API functionality status  
**Required Action**: Test every endpoint methodically with proper authentication

## üìã **SPECIFIC NEXT ACTIONS NEEDED**

### 1. Fix Token Management for Testing
```bash
# Option 1: Extend token expiration in JWT service
# Option 2: Create test script that refreshes tokens automatically
# Option 3: Implement refresh token mechanism
```

### 2. Verify Data Layer
```bash
# Check S3 bucket contents
aws s3 ls s3://studyappv2-data-dev-936777225289-1754771691341/
# Test question data accessibility from Lambda
```

### 3. Complete API Testing Matrix

| Endpoint | Method | Auth Required | Status | Issues |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------|---------|
| /auth/register | POST | No | ‚úÖ Working | None |
| /auth/login | POST | No | ‚úÖ Working | None |
| /providers | GET | Yes | ‚úÖ Working | None |
| /questions | GET | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Token expiration suspected |
| /sessions | POST | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /sessions/{id} | GET | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /sessions/{id} | PUT | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /sessions/{id}/answers | POST | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /sessions/{id}/complete | POST | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /goals | GET | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /goals | POST | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /goals/{id} | GET | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /analytics | GET | Yes | ‚ùì Unknown | Not tested |
| /health | GET | No | ‚úÖ Working | Shows "unhealthy" status |

### 4. End-to-End Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test complete user journey:
# 1. Register user
# 2. Login to get token
# 3. Create study session
# 4. Get first question
# 5. Submit answer
# 6. Check progress
# 7. Complete session
# 8. View analytics
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR COMPLETION**

### Must Have
- [ ] All API endpoints return 200/400/401/403 (not 500 errors)
- [ ] Questions endpoint returns actual question data
- [ ] Sessions can be created and managed successfully
- [ ] User progress is tracked and stored correctly
- [ ] Complete user workflow functions end-to-end

### Documentation
- [ ] Update V2 guide with actual endpoint test results
- [ ] Document any additional fixes required
- [ ] Provide working examples for each endpoint

## üö© **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### High Risk
- **Token Management**: May need architecture changes for longer testing sessions
- **Data Layer**: S3 question data may be missing or inaccessible
- **Complex Endpoints**: Sessions/Analytics may have business logic issues

### Medium Risk  
- **DynamoDB Queries**: Additional GSI issues may be discovered
- **Lambda Dependencies**: Other runtime issues beyond bcrypt
- **API Gateway Config**: Missing routes or incorrect auth assignments

## üîÑ **HANDOFF NOTES**

### What's Stable
- Infrastructure deployment process
- Authentication system architecture
- TOKEN authorizer implementation
- DynamoDB GSI configuration

### What Needs Investigation
- Actual data availability and accessibility
- Complete API functionality beyond auth
- Real-world user workflow performance
- System health beyond basic connectivity

## üìû **FOR NEXT DEVELOPER**

1. **Start with token expiration fix** - This is blocking all testing
2. **Verify S3 data exists** - Questions endpoint depends on this
3. **Test systematically** - Don't assume anything works without verification
4. **Document actual results** - Update guides with real test outcomes

**Status**: üü° **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Auth breakthrough achieved but comprehensive testing incomplete  
**Next Steps**: Complete the testing that was requested but not delivered  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality verification required for production readiness
